    You have these 7 themes:
    {themes_description}
          
    For each year below, assign topics to themes and calculate total confidence scores.
          
    Rules:
    - A topic can contribute to multiple themes if it genuinely fits
    - Only assign topics that clearly belong to a theme - don't force poor matches
    - Sum the confidence scores of all topics assigned to each theme
    - If a theme has no topics in a year, its score is 0
    - Be consistent with theme names (use exact names from the list above)
          
    Years and topics:
    {"\n".join(summary_lines)}
          
    Return JSON format with ALL 7 themes for each year:
    {{
      "YEAR1": {{"{theme_names[0]}": 0.0, "{theme_names[1]}": 0.0, "{theme_names[2]}": 0.0, "{theme_names[3]}": 0.0, "{theme_names[4]}": 0.0, "{theme_names[5]}": 0.0, "{theme_names[6]}": 0.0}},
      "YEAR2": {{"{theme_names[0]}": 0.0, "{theme_names[1]}": 0.0, "{theme_names[2]}": 0.0, "{theme_names[3]}": 0.0, "{theme_names[4]}": 0.0, "{theme_names[5]}": 0.0, "{theme_names[6]}": 0.0}},
      ...
    }}
          
    Replace YEAR1, YEAR2 with actual years and 0.0 with calculated confidence sums. Include all years present in the data.
