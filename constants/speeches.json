  "1986": "Truly, it is a great privilege to be able to express my appreciation for the honor of serving as president of the Society for Vascular Surgery. Aware of my own limited contributions, with pride in the possession of your friendship, and with the memory of a long and rewarding association with this most congenial company of surgeons, I am engulfed by feelings of humility. Happily, rescue comes with the opportunity to talk with you about an issue of great concern to many of us\u2014the intellectual health of vascular surgery. It is tempting at a time like this to consider other problems surrounding our profession: economic, political, and regulatory issues; the presumed need for specialty recognition; the complex issues surrounding the training and certification of the vascular surgeon; and the process by which vascular surgeon; and the process by which vascular surgery privileges may be granted. However, these matters concern the educational and administrative health of vascular surgery and although troublesome, I suggest they are peripheral to our primary responsibility\u2014the theory and practice of vascular surgery.I have spent the greater part of my life in pursuit of knowledge about occlusive arterial disease. Much of this effort has been directed toward learning to apply our technologically advanced but conceptually simple methods of diagnosis and treatment. Most of what I have learned about arterial disease consists of information of a descriptive nature on the basis of observations of mine and others: the size of the plaque, its preference for bifurcations, and some biochemical and histologic characteristics. This understanding of vascular disease is probably true for most vascular surgeons. What we have accepted as knowledge is essentially information based on description and classification.So, too, with our surgical interventions. Realizing that atherosclerosis could be treated surgically because of its segmental distribution and with the availability of inert polymer fabric tubes, we have accumulated many observations on the response of synthetic fabrics in mammalian tissue. This body of information is largely of a reactive or after-the-fact nature. Tubes were placed in the experimental animal as well as in the human model. One awaited the response. The uniformly successful performance of synthetic fabrics in the aorta and other large vessels created a sense of professional achievement and satisfaction. Nevertheless, we have learned very little about prevention of the disease we profess to treat. More importantly, because it is in our area of therapeutic responsibility, we have only recently begun a systematic study of the causes of failure of some of the thousands of grafts we insert each year. As busy surgeons, on occasion preoccupied with a host of professional and personal intrusions for which there are no ready solutions, we have only recently become aware of the profound and revolutionary developments occurring in the biologic sciences, especially in cell biology.Until the 1930s, the practice of medicine was largely empirical. This segmentation of clinical practice and valid basic scientific information should not be faulted for there was little \u201cgood\u201d science throughout clinical medicine. One need only recall the enthusiasm with which many surgical procedures were introduced, used for a short time, and then abandoned. Internal mammary artery ligation in the treatment of ischemic heart disease was discredited by the simple, albeit long-delayed, step of performing a random study in which the results of a simple intercostal incision were compared with actual ligation. Other examples are gastric freezing in the treatment of peptic ulcer; jejunoileal bypass to solve psychiatric problems; supraradical surgical procedures for control of cancer, particularly of the breast and pelvis; and periarterial stripping of the adventitia of the femoral artery (a segmental sympathectomy) for the relief of lower extremity ischemia. Relief of cerebral ischemia was attempted by excision of the cervical sympathetic ganglia. As recently as the late 1940s and early 1950s, carotid arterial blood was rerouted to the internal jugular vein in an attempt to increase cerebral perfusion and improve the mentation of retarded children. Several of us early in our careers disconnected these arteriovenous fistulas. The creation of arteriovenous fistulas to ameliorate discrepancies in leg length in growing children, and ligation of the popliteal vein to lessen the burden of venous insufficiency in the postphlebitic leg are additional examples of surgical enthusiasm unsupported by good science. Leriche said it simply and effectively, \u201cThe great problem of surgery is a problem of knowledge.\u201dBetter science, which means better data, is making better medicine possible. The discovery of the magic helix, the identification of gene loci, the perfection of biologic probes and markers, the identification and mapping of receptor sites on cell membranes, in short, our increasing ability to look beyond the traditional unit of the cell and into the molecular organization within and surrounding it provides opportunities for biologic exploration that stagger my imagination and may rival what is yet to be learned in outer space. I shall return to this, but first, to provide perspective and to emphasize the opportunity before us, a brief review of the development of reconstructive arterial surgery as we practice it in 1986 is warranted.Brief historyThat the development of reconstructive arterial surgery followed a mechanical direction is not surprising. During the 1930s and 1940s several investigators realized that most of the serious circulatory disorders were mechanical in nature and should be susceptible to mechanical solution. Grosssuccessfully ligated a patent ductus arteriosus in 1938. In 1945 Crafoord and Nylinreported successful reconstruction of aortic coarctation. It soon became apparent that an arterial conduit occasionally was necessary to replace the narrowed segment. Hufnagelintroduced a method of rapid freezing of homologous arteries, and Gross preserved homologous arteries in tissue culture solution. Gross et al.were the first to place an allograft in a human thoracic aorta. Such grafts had to be obtained under aseptic conditions until Hufnagelintroduced ethylene oxide as a sterilizing agent. Arterial homografts, sterilized by radiation and a variety of other agents and techniques, became somewhat more available. The substitution of a human artery free of disease, albeit sterilized and dehydrated, for the diseased one of a patient seemed a reasonable approach to the enthusiastic and imaginative surgeons of the 1940s and 1950s. Historical evidence that complex tissues cannot be exchanged between members of the same species was ignored.Beginning with Dubost, Allary, and Oeconomos,who replaced an abdominal aortic aneurysm with a homograft in 1952, many pioneering surgeons used homografts in several anatomic locations.Degenerative changes and closure rates of up to 70% in lower extremity grafts during a follow-up period of 2 to 3 years were reported.Szilagyi et al.warned that when implanted into the aorta such grafts might begin to endanger life after approximately 5 years. Clearly, there were many reasons to find suitable substitutes.Homografts became in short supply as replacement was used more widely. The techniques of sterilization and preservation were cumbersome; however, failure to retain tensile strength was the basic reason for the abandonment of homografts. Let us recall the words of Arthur Voorhees:...while serving in a fellowship at Columbia in 1947, I stumbled on the notion of using a permeable fabric tube as an arterial graft. This followed a serendipitous observation in an experimental animal that endocardium would grow around a silk suture traversing the ventricular cavity of the left heart. My observation gave rise to the speculation that a cloth would provide a latticework of strands on which the body might build its own graft by laying down cells in the interstices of the cloth.Widespread laboratory experimentation was made possible by the largesse of the National Institutes of Health in the 1960s and the availability of many young men and women seeking additional training. The luminal surface of the synthetic fabrics was found to be covered by a glistening coat composed of flattened fibroblasts and collagen fibers and lacking elastic and smooth muscle elements (Fig. 1).However, fibroblasts did grow through the interstices of the cloth.Words such as porosity, compliance, durability, flexibility, and biologic inertness joined the surgical vocabulary. Dacron, introduced about 1953, and Teflon, somewhat later, replaced Vinyon \u201cN\u201d, nylon, and Orlon, which were all tested and abandoned. In 1954 Blakemore and Voorheesreported the replacement of 17 abdominal and one popliteal aneurysm with synthetic fabric tubes. In 1955 Deterling and Bhonslaysummarized the many synthetic fabrics then in use as blood vessel replacements, and in 1957 a committee appointed by this society reported on the status of synthetic prostheses at that time.An impressive and vigorous surgical subspecialty was born.Development of these arterial substitutes was not the consequence of careful study of the properties of the human artery. Although much work was done by many investigators working with textile engineers to define acceptable standards of synthetic grafts, the basic objective was the development of a tube to serve as an \u201cimitation of the human artery in terms of its simplest function, namely a mechanical conduit.\u201dAlthough porosity was recognized as essential for host incorporation of the prosthesis, the amount of porosity and the degree of graft incorporation are not thoroughly understood even today. Histologic examination of the healed graft in the human model fails to support the argument that fibrous tissue incorporation secures the pseudointima. Although the thickness of this pseudointima may vary in different types of grafts and with different degrees of porosity, its main component in all prostheses implanted in the human being is an amorphous, largely acellular layer of compacted fibrin, probably the remnant of organized clot and with no evidence either of any anchoring strands of granulation tissue or true endothelium.Crimping, introduced in 1955 by Edwards and Tappto prevent buckling, may be a rheologic disadvantage in the early phase of healing of small-diameter grafts. Noncrimped small-diameter grafts, supported by a spirally wound semirigid external plastic coil, are reported to be associated with improved late patency rates (Fig. 2).Stated in its simplest form, the further down any graft is placed in the peripheral arterial tree, the poorer is its performance (Fig. 3).Anastomotic hyperplasiaInclusion of the word intima as in neointima, pseudointima, and neointimal hyperplasia in the description of the healing phenomenon taking place within the graft and at the anastomotic line of the artery is unfortunate. This association confers a sense of acceptability as if intima were truly involved, it implies a deeper understanding of the healing process than exists, and it discourages critical analysis. A better word probably first introduced in this context by Voorhees, Jaretski, and Blakemoreis pannus (from the Latin, a piece of cloth) and used variously to describe a superficial vascularization of the cornea with infiltration of granulation tissue or, as another instance, the inflammatory exudate overlying the inner lining of synovial cells of the inflamed joint. However used, the pseudointima is an unnatural and abnormal collection of material with ominous implications should it increase. Such is the state of affairs at the junction of a synthetic tube and a host artery.The pannus of anastomotic hyperplasia first came to my attention in 1960 in a canine study of the functional similarity of bypass arterial grafts and collateral vessels. With the use of fresh autogenous isodiametric end-to-side arterial grafts in the femoral artery, and with silk as a suture material, an incomplete, partially obstructing eccentric membrane developed at the distal end of the anastomosis (Fig. 4).Histologically the membrane resembled an endothelial lining with none of the characteristics of an organized thrombus. This outgrowth of \u201cendothelium\u201d along the stoma we interpreted as a natural response of the vessel to injury. We recorded the phenomenon and speculated as to the need for additional investigative work. Twenty-five years later a full understanding of the problem and its control continue to elude us although a voluminous literature full of hypotheses as to cause has accumulated.Numerous experimental models for its study have been developed.DeWeese et al. in 1975 described the cells of the hyperplastic lesion in the dog as being predominantly contractile smooth muscle or myoblasts and protein-secreting myofibroblasts. Such fibrinous tissue was found in all synthetic grafts they examined and in all fabric modifications and was most severe in the human umbilical vein and bovine heterografts.Autogenous veins had the least amount. In a high flow renal artery\u2014vena cava arte-riovenous fistula model Imparato et al.in 1974 demonstrated that stripping of endothelial cells does occur.LoGerfo et al.suggested that platelet aggregation and release of platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) occurs as a consequence of unfavorable activities within the boundary layer of turbulent flow. In the dog hyperplasia is greater at the distal end. Hagen et al.in 1982 demonstrated that severe intimal hyperplasia develops rapidly in the recipient vessel adjacent to small-diameter expanded polytetrafluoroethylene (ePTFE) grafts and that the severity of the response could be reduced by antiplatelet agents.In an elegant study of grafts recovered from human beings, Sottiurai et al.demonstrated that complete reendothelialization occurred in all vein grafts and intimal hyperplasia in 6 of 11 grafts. In prosthetic grafts no endothelialization was seen and intimal hyperplasia was present in all. The lesion consisted of fibroblasts, fibrous matrix, and some smooth muscle cells. \u201cThe change in smooth muscle cell function from one of contractility to one of secretory activity seems to be the unique pathologic feature in intimal hyperplasia,\u201d an observation reported by Leung, Glagov, and Mathews10 years earlier. Madras et al.in 1981 demonstrated that blood passing through a vascular prosthesis was highly activated and rapid platelet deposition was noted. In 1984 Pomposelli et al.produced a hyperplastic subintimal lesion in the rabbit aorta after insertion of an intraluminal device that altered arterial wall stress. An intimal fibrous plaque with collagen and spindle-shaped cells developed in animals killed after 1 month. The luminal surface of the lesion was covered in part with flattened cells consistent in shape with endothelium.Hasson, Megerman, and Abbottstated in 1986 that compliance mismatch \u201c...can no longer be described simply by the nominal difference in compliance between artery and graft\u201d but rather may be an additional mismatch of the suture line.Because availability of an oral analog of prostacyclin seemed imminent and this might be used to inhibit the PDGF earlier identified by Gajdusck et al.,our group looked at platelet deposition, inhibition, and dissemination in the baboon (Fig. 5).The fewer differences between the human and baboon coagulation systems seemed to be an advantage not possessed by other experimental animals.The thought that repeated endothelial cell damage occurred at the anastomotic line, thereby resulting in platelet adherence and stimulation of vascular smooth muscle overgrowth, suggested an important area to study. By means of an ex vivo shunt we demonstrated that aspirin inhibited platelet deposition on Dacron and ePTFE grafts as did heparin to a comparable degree.Pretreatment with a single dose of aspirin decreased platelet uptake on 4 mm Dacron interposition grafts in the carotid artery (Fig. 6).This was associated with an improvement in short-term graft patency (Fig. 7).With the use of autogenous indium 111\u2014labeled platelets exposed to blood flow for 2\u00bd hours at rates of 25 and 200 ml/min, platelet adhesion was found to be independent of flow. The least platelet-reactive material was ePTFE with human umbilical vein (HUV) intermediate, and knitted Dacron the most thrombogenic.Fibrin deposition was also inhibited by both aspirin and heparin.Having noted heavy infiltration with polymorphonuclear neutrophils in both seeded and non-seeded grafts, and realizing that complement activated polymorphonuclear neutrophils to damage endothelial cells, we looked at complement activation by grafts. The plasma of 10 healthy human donors was assayed for complement activity after incubation with short segments of knitted Dacron and ePTFE grafts. Dacron caused substantial complement activation and ePTFE virtually none. Activation by Dacron appeared to occur via both the classical and alternative complement pathways (Figs. 8 and 9).Although many clinical studies that used antiplatelet agents have reported decreased platelet uptake in synthetic vascular grafts and some improvement in patency rates as well, what beneficial effect these agents may provide seems to be limited to suppression of early thrombosis rather than to reduction of late failure.Clearly, it seems too facile to ascribe the problems of anastomotic hyperplasia and early and late graft failure only to the platelet, however active a role it may play in the process.With the realization that autologous tissue, both vein and artery, is the best arterial substituteand that an intact endothelium is a most important element, it was a reasonable next step to place endothelial cells on fabric grafts. One might anticipate not only improved patency results but also an opportunity to study the biologic aspects of reconstructive vascular surgery. Our attention quite appropriately is now being directed to the cells that make up the arterial wall, to the environment in which they live, and to the molecular organization of this environment.Since Herring, Gardner, and Gloverapplied the concept in 1978, many laboratories have been successful in obtaining coverage of a synthetic graft with endothelial cells derived from several species, including the cow, the dog, the baboon, and more recently the human being. Using indium 111\u2014labeled baboon platelets for the imaging of implanted endothelial cell-seeded grafts, we noted substantial reduction of platelet uptake (Fig. 10).Synthetic grafts seeded with baboon endothelial cells showed nearly complete luminal endothelialization within a few weeks of seeding.In our laboratory, neither ePTFE nor Dacron supported adhesion and growth of human endothelial cells unless modified with collagen and fibronectin. Collagen not only promoted adhesion of cells but influenced their growth, differentiation, and migration. Fibronectin appears to function in vivo as a biologically important attachment molecule with binding sites for collagen and cells.However, it must be remembered that platelets, once they have been activated by factors released by other platelets at the clotting site, develop specific binding sites for fibronectin.Laminin, an element of the basement membrane, may be more effective and biologically more appropriate to serve as a precoating agent.In our studies of attachment of bovine endothelial cells on ePTFE grafts in an ex vivo shunt model, radionuclide scans with indium 111\u2014oxine showed, after an initial loss, only a 7% additional loss at low flow (i.e., 20 ml/min) and 11% loss at 200 ml/min, each of which was run for 60 minutes (Figs. 11 and 12).In seeded small-caliber Dacron grafts, placed in the baboon carotid artery and compared with the contralateral control graft, only a marginal difference in patency rates was observed at 5 weeks. However, platelet accumulation on the seeded grafts was significantly less (p <0.05) than on paired control grafts.The biologic ERAIt has been demonstrated many times that endothelial cell seeding at the time of implantation of arterial prostheses is feasible. Such seeding promotes subsequent endothelialization of the luminal surface, with inhibition of platelet adhesion. However, it is yet to be established that these cells continue to function in a normal fashion, exerting their controls over thrombosis and abnormal cell growth, so crucial to the success of arterial surgery.In response to the observation of Gimbronethat cultured endothelial cells as a consequence of phenotypic modulation can respond to a variety of specific stimuli, one must inquire as to the functional status of the seeded endothelial cell. Is the polymer of the arterial substitute, even when coated with collagen and fibronectin, adequate for the support of the endothelial cell? Does the seeded endothelial cell receive the same support as provided by its natural basement membrane or is it abnormally activated in such a way as to cause it to express new functions, some of which may be undesirable? There are many complex interactions between the endothelium, the constituents of the blood, the cells and other elements of the vascular wall, and a dynamic reciprocal relationship exists between all elements.Anticoagulant and procoagulant functionsSpecific anticoagulant functions expressed by the endothelial cell are the consequence of the surface glycosaminoglycans of the heparan sulfate class,which bind the serum protein antithrombin III,the synthesis of prostacyclin,as well as tissue plasminogen activatorand thrombomodulin, a protein found on the surface of the endothelial cell that binds prothrombin and activated protein C.Procoagulant activities of the endothelial cell are the result of actions of bacterial endotoxin,interleukin-1 (IL-1),and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) also known as cachectin,a protein secreted by the activated human mononuclear phagocyte, the von Willebrand factor (factor VIII\u2014related antigen),and other extracellular matrix proteins,including thrombospondin,collagen types 4, 5, and 8,and fibronectin.In all probability the control of the thrombogenicity of the vascular wall in vivo is a consequence or the net effect of the several anticoagulant and procoagulant activities described.Smooth muscle cell and fibroblast growth and inhibitionIllustrative of our limited understanding concerning the cell type of the hyperplastic anastomotic lesion is the use of the term \u201cmyofibroblast.\u201d This cell of undetermined origin, possibly an atypical fibroblast, or the \u201csynthetic\u201d phenotype of the smooth muscle cell, or from a mixed population including blood-borne precursors,is in all likelihood responsible for anastomotic proliferation. Both smooth muscle cells and fibroblasts are stimulated by the PDGF and other platelet products.It is postulated that endothelial cell seeding by limiting platelet activation may also limit anastomotic hyperplasia. However, under laboratory conditions, endothelial cells secrete material that stimulates both smooth muscle cell and fibroblast proliferation.Clowes et al.have shown in the baboon that even in the presence of an established endothelial cell lining on the graft, a stimulus for anastomotic hyperplasia persists. With a graft of greater porosity than that in clinical use, 60 rather than 30 \u03bcm a complete lining of endothelial cells developed within 10 to 14 days of implantation, presumably of capillary ingrowth origin. Substantial cellular hyperplasia at the anastomotic regions was noted despite complete endothelialization. Increased thymidine labeling of smooth muscle nuclei was also noted, consistent with increased production of mitogens of the endothelial cells resting on the synthetic surface in vivo.Inhibitors of smooth muscle cell proliferation are produced by the heparin-like glycosaminoglycans.Thus, as with the anticoagulant and procoagulant activities of the endothelial cell, there are multiple proliferative and antiproliferative activities acting on the vessel wall in response to injury of the artery. The development of anastomatic hyperplasia in all likelihood is a result of the balance of forces in this complex process.Leukocyte adhesionThe activated mononuclear phagocyte and polymorphonuclear leukocyte injure endothelial cells through the secretion of proteases and oxygen radicals.\u201cActivated\u201d endothelial cells may bind leukocytes that in turn may activate the white cell. Therefore, the maintenance of an endothelial lining may be determined in part at least by the interaction of the endothelial cell and the leukocyte (Fig. 13).Clearly, the next phase in the progress of endothelial cell seeding appears to be in pursuit of this new information concerning endothelial cell and vascular wall biology.Extension of the biologic route as a way to improve small-caliber graft patency rates has recently assumed three interesting developments. A small-caliber vascular graft has been prepared from mixtures of polyurethane and poly-L-lactic acid by van der Lei et al.When implanted into the rat abdominal aorta, these microporous biodegradable vascular grafts served as a temporary scaffold for the regeneration of a neoarterial wall, said to be as thromboresistant as the normal rat abdominal aorta.The implants were harvested at 6 weeks and are stated to have excellent neoendothelial healing characteristics.Weinberg and Bellhave developed a blood vessel model with three layers corresponding to an intima, media, and adventitia. On this model, endothelial cells grew to confluence after their injection into the lumen of a tube prepared by casting culture medium, collagen, and smooth muscle cells together in an annular mold and supported by an external Dacron mesh. The middle layer revealed a high density of smooth muscle cells and matrix material, an outer layer of adventitial fibroblasts, and matrix materials from bovine sources.We believe that endothelial cells must be in proximity to vascular smooth muscle to carry on their normal functions and be less likely to express undesirable functions. As a consequence, we have grown bovine vascular endothelial and smooth muscle cells in coculture.These experiments showed that stable collagen matrix gels can be seeded with smooth muscle cells and that a surface layer of endothelial cells can be established and maintained in a viable state with stable morphology (Figs. 14 and 15).To produce a biologic graft composed of all the elements of the normal arterial wall becomes an attractive challenge. Important among the many specific delicately balanced interrelated functions of the arterial wall are selective permeability of the endothelium, its capability to inhibit thrombosis, and the viscoelasticity of the medial smooth muscle and collagen fibers. Additional factors are the influence of the extracellular matrix on growth and metabolism of the cellular elements and the self-reparative capability of all these elements.The research climateFrom the 1982 report of the Research Training and Development Task Group comes the statement, \u201cAn important area which has been relatively neglected is that of peripheral vascular disease. More manpower is desirable to extend scientific and methodological advances to improve understanding and control of peripheral vascular disease.\u201dConstant dollars in obligated funds for all programs from the National Institutes of Health (NIH) are showing a decline from the high point of 1979 (Fig. 16).In fiscal 1984, the total NIH budget was $4.47 billion, permitting the funding of approximately 5400 grants, generally those with a priority score of 150 or less.In 1973 21% of the total research allotment of the NIH went to departments of internal medicine. Departments of surgery received 13.8%, which by 1982 had decreased to 5.1%. Internal medicine's share, 21% in 1973, increased to 27% in 1982. Ranks of medical research are increasingly filled by scientists who are not medically trained. The increasing participation of Ph.D. scientists in fields traditionally identified with cardiovascular research would be welcomed if it were not also accompanied by a simultaneous decrease in medical-clinical investigators involved in such research. From 1972 to 1983 the Heart and Blood Vessel Disease branch of NIH awarded 212 traineeships and fellowships to holders of the Ph.D. degree and 630 holders of the M.D. degree. From 1980 to 1982, Ph.D. recipients numbered 358 vs. 291 M.D. recipients (Fig. 17).The most devastating effect of funding instability is the discouragement of the young from entering scientific research. One wonders about the productivity half-life of a young investigator, fresh from a residency training program, who wishes to enter a career involving practice, teaching, and research. Contributing to the disinterest among physicians in seeking postdoctoral research training are the increasing indebtedness of the graduating physician of whom a higher percentage are married, the economic disparity between private, full-time clinical practice and academic careers, the change in lifestyles that makes spending weekends in the laboratory incompatible with social aspirations, and very probably the increasing complexity and expense of investigative technology now necessary for first-rate research. One wonders what measures might be considered to reverse this trend, for surgeons surely must be involved in research. Without them, \u201cthere would be no cardiopulmonary bypass, no transplantation, no joint replacements, no reconstructive arterial surgery whatsoever.\u201dWyngaardenoffers three decision guidelines. (1) The pursuit of basic knowledge is the foundation of all progress in the health sciences; (2) a supply of well-trained scientists must be maintained; and (3) the greatest promise of significant discovery comes from research that is initiated by investigators. Let me provide and encouraging note. First, we must not depend exclusively on the NIH to provide us with our funds. We must seek other sources. Time does not permit more than a brief mention but the National Science Foundation, the American Heart Association, and other public agencies and private foundations do exist. Second, departments of surgery within hospitals and universities can provide seed money to enable young investigators to make a start and assist them in the competition for extramural funding. The rewards of serving in an academic department must not be based primarily on clinical income. In addition to disbursement of intramural funds, recognition of academic accomplishment must be made and an environment congenial and supportive to the pursuit of research must be provided. Selective involvement in a multidisciplinary effort should be fostered since it is unlikely that significant new basic science information will be the product of the efforts of surgeon investigators by themselves. That day has largely passed. More often this requires the highly skilled full-time professional scientist. There is a temptation for surgeons to dabble in basic science and many acquire substantial training. Such surgeons can bridge the gap between the information developed by the basic scientist and the needs of clinical practice. In this way all can contribute. An additional contribution, this to be provided by the full-time clinical surgeon, is a careful analysis of his or her own surgical experience. Of the estimated 100,000 carotid endarterectomies performed during 1984 (Moore W. Communication to Advisory Committee on Carotid Endarterectomy of the Society for Vascular Surgery/International Society for Cardiovascular Surgery, 1986), how many are being subjected to rigorous analysis and careful follow-up? How many of the questions that trouble us today, 30 years since the first carotid endarterectomy was performed, might now be answered with data from community practice? The clinical surgeon must subject his activities to critical scrutiny and realize that his decisions may be less close to the ideal than he supposes and would wish. In the words of Salzman,\u201cBecause a surgeon tells you he has operated on a large number of patients with a certain rate of success does not necessarily mean his choice of treatment was therefore the best choice.... Be critical of the literature, demand proper controls, objective end-points... and may your patients be protected by the reliability of your knowledge.\u201dI submit that as vascular surgeons we are firmly embedded in the halfway technology described by Lewis Thomasin his delightfulLives Of A Cell. He describes three categories, the first of which he calls \u201cnon-technology.\u201d This consists of tiding patients through disease with reassurance, long periods of hospitalization, and great expense. Caring for patients with intractable cancer is an example. Halfway technology, the second category, consists of doing things after the disease has had its way to compensate for the incapacitating effect of diseases that we poorly understand and which efforts are designed to post-pone death. Organ transplantation is a prime example and, in the case of the kidney, may not be needed once we understand the mechanisms leading to the destruction of glomeruli. Much of cancer therapy is directed at the established cancer cell and not at the mechanisms by which the cells become malignant. The third and highest level of technology, the only genuinely decisive technology of medicine, is best exemplified by such things as immunization against disease and control of bacterial infection.Our understanding of atherosclerosis and our attempts to \u201ctreat it\u201d represent an example of halfway technology. We have accumulated a large body of knowledge in a very few decades. Recent emphasis has been on our grafts, our catheters, our image intensifiers\u2014our tools. Our technology is so successful that we are in danger of being lulled into a sense of great achievement. \u201cMan becomes the tool of his tools\u201dand we are at risk.It is time for a new frame of reference\u2014a new direction. For example, I am confident that our regard for atherosclerosis will be substantially changed in the next one or two decades. Atherosclerosis will be considered a preventable disease. The mechanisms by which cholesterol-laden lipoproteins become incorporated into vulnerable cells are rapidly being mastered. The apportionment of synthesis of the high-density vs. low-density lipoprotein is now being described in terms of the regulation of the expression of specific deoxyribonucleic acid sequences. The genes have been identified and mapped. What remains is to find the mechanisms by which these genes can be activated or held in restraint.As cellular organization took precedence over gross examination and description, so too molecular organization now takes precedence. We have the opportunity to understand the mechanisms of disease. More immediately there is an opportunity to develop a fund of knowledge that may result in the design of better prosthetic grafts and a better understanding of the biologic reasons for their failure. I believe we are in the dawn of a new era\u2014the acquisition of knowledge that may change the lives of generations to come. Failure of grafts because of progression of distal disease, \u201credo\u201d operations because of anastomotic hyperplasia, fragmentation of graft fabrics, calcification of the graft or the valve implant, and similar problems will become items of historical interest. Which of the operations we are doing today will be the discards of the next decade? What is needed is knowledge and such knowledge will be provided by the young among us and those yet to come. Let me paraphrase William Wordsworth: Bliss is it in this dawn to be alive, but to be young is very heaven.This address is dedicated to the memory of Eleanor Magee Callow.",
  "1987": "First of all, I would like to express my profound thanks and appreciation to the membership for the privilege of serving as your President this past year. As a vascular surgeon, the presidency of the Society for Vascular Surgery (SVS) is the highest honor and certainly the one that I will most treasure.During the past 15 years, the science and technology of vascular surgery together with the training of vascular surgeons have undergone advances of revolutionary proportion. However, at the very time when significant progress seems to have been achieved in the processes of education and quality of care, there are forces at work that threaten to jeopardize these achievements. We are at risk of a serious backslide in recognizing the importance of training and qualifications of young surgeons who wish to do vascular surgery. This poses a major threat to the care of patients with vascular disease. We are being told that because vascular surgery is a primary component in the general surgery training curriculum, any and all graduates of approved general surgery training programs should be considered as qualified to manage the spectrum of vascular surgery problems. To examine the implications of this statement, we need to review briefly the observations made by the leadership in vascular surgery during the past 17 years that led to (what we consider) major improvements in the training of vascular surgeons and the performance of vascular surgery.The late Jack Wylie, in his presidential address before the International Cardiovascular Society (ICVS) in June 1970 expressed serious concern about the training of surgeons doing vascular surgery and the impact that the presence or absence of training had on surgical outcome. He noted at that time the requirement for vascular surgery privileges in most community hospitals was either certification by the American Board of Surgery or the completion of an accredited program in surgery. Only a few community hospitals required that the applicant complete a course of special training in vascular surgery. He went on to state that there were three categories of surgeons doing vascular surgery. The first category comprised those who had formal training, including extensive experience with vascular surgery. He included in this group established surgeons who were in practice when vascular surgery developed and acquired the necessary skills by dedication and by the devotion of a major percentage of their time to vascular surgery. He noted that in this group the standards of care were high and that competence was maintained by constant exposure. He also noted that in 1970, the number of surgeons in this category was in short supply. The second category that he identified comprised those surgeons who were self-declared specialists in vascular disease who were motivated by interest rather than aptitude or acquired skills. In this category he noted that the numbers were many. Finally, the third group of surgeons were those who were accomplished in other areas of general surgery but who only occasionally performed vascular surgical operations. Dr. Wylie observed that among the surgeons in categories 2 and 3, indications for operation on vascular disease were ill-founded and there was a high frequency of disastrous complications. To address this problem, Dr. Wylie proposed two alternative solutions; the first solution would be to develop appropriate training within existing general surgery programs that would provide a rotation of up to 12 months on dedicated vascular services to develop sufficient judgment and skill among trainees in general surgery programs. The second alternative was to develop a postresidency fellowship in vascular surgery. He stated that the first priority would be to accredit training programs that were providing sufficient exposure in properly performed vascular surgery. The second priority would be to develop a process of certification by the American Board of Surgery for those persons appropriately trained and judged to be proficient in the performance of vascular surgery.The following year, in his presidential address to the ICVS, Jack Cannon reaffirmed Jack Wylie's observations. He noted that the most important aspect of vascular surgery training was the acquisition of judgment. He pointed out that brief rotations on vascular surgery services, while sufficient for developing technical skills, were totally inadequate for the development of judgment in the general surgery resident. He cited several examples of poor judgment in the management of vascular cases from his own community. Dr. Cannon called for the establishment of a committee, from members of both the ICVS and SVS, to look into the problem of establishing training programs in vascular surgery and the development of an appropriate curriculum. He also pointed out that his committee should be concerned with the analysis of manpower needs in vascular surgery.Dr. Wylie's observations concerning the performance of suboptimal vascular surgery were based on personal experience as well as data being acquired by the Committee on Vascular Surgery of the Intersociety Commission of Heart Disease Resources, supported by the American Heart Association. The vascular surgery committee, consisting of James A. DeWeese as Chairman, F. William Blaisdell, and John Foster, published its report in the August 1972 issue ofCirculationand published the report again in the December 1972 issue of theArchives of Surgery.The DeWeese Committee looked at data based on a survey from the American Hospital Association and the Regional Medical Program Service in June 1970. A total of 4616 short-term general hospital were reviewed; the experience with six standard arterial reconstructive procedures was surveyed, which included femoropopliteal bypass, aortoiliac operations, renal vascular operations, carotid artery surgery, abdominal aortic aneurysm (elective), and emergency abdominal aortic aneurysm resection. The committee examined the percentage of reporting hospitals that did 10 or less of these operations during the course of a year. In the case of femoropopliteal bypass grafting, 924 of 1472 reporting hospitals (63%) had done 10 or less. In the case of aortoiliac operations, 69% had done 10 or less annually. In the case of renovascular reconstruction, 83% had done 10 or less. In the case of carotid artery surgery, 66% had done 10 or less. In the case of elective abdominal aortic aneurysm resection, 75% had done 10 or less. Finally, in the case of emergency resection of abdominal aortic aneurysm, 88% had done 10 or less. The committee noted that there was little information regarding the qualifications of surgeons performing these vascular operations. The committee concluded by saying, \u201c...these observations in the opinion of many of our peers suggest that a considerable amount of suboptimal vascular surgery is being performed in this country.\u201d The committee stated that one of the possible reasons for this deficiency is inadequate training of those performing vascular surgery. They noted that whereas several general surgical or thoracic and cardiovascular surgical programs can provide the necessary experience, most centers do not have the volume of cases needed for training both general and vascular surgeons.After the report of the DeWeese committee, there developed a proliferation of \u201cvascular fellowships\u201d throughout the United States. Bill Blaisdell, in his presidential address to the SVS in 1979, criticized the development of unstructured, unreviewed, and self-proclaimed vascular fellowships. He discussed the role of vascular surgery as a part of the training program for a general surgeon but pointed out the fallacy of considering general surgeons, at the completion of their residency, to be expert in all of the components of general surgery, including vascular surgery.Dr. Blaisdell's presidential address set the stage for the establishment of a review mechanism for vascular surgery training programs, under the auspices of the two vascular societies. It was understood that this was an interim measure until such time as this process could be taken over by the Residency Review Committee. The Residency Review Committee would take on this responsibility once the American Board of Surgery recognized the validity of additional training in vascular surgery and developed an examination process for special qualifications in vascular surgery. The Program Evaluation and Endorsement Committee (PEEC Committee) proceeded to review programs and provided a tremendous service to young candidates seeking additional training in vascular surgery. PEEC Committee\u2014approved programs were identified as those programs that would provide the necessary training and experience in contrast to those programs that were adding fellows simply to fill manpower needs and service requirements. It was not until 1981 that the \u201cessentials\u201d were approved by the American Board of surgery, the Residency Review Committee for Surgery, and the Residency Review Committee for Thoracic Surgery. The then projected date of implementation for examination and certification of special qualification was to be 1983, 11 years after the recommendations for such programs by the DeWeese committee report in 1972.With the establishment of an examination mechanism for Certification of Special Qualifications in Vascular Surgery and the review and approval mechanism of training programs by the Residency Review Committee, we now seem to be on the track of progress that ideally will improve the quality of vascular surgical care for patients in North America. The relationship between vascular and general surgery continues to be a subject of some debate. In 1981, John Mannick, in his presidential address to the SVS, expressed the opinion that all vascular surgery in this country would not necessarily be performed by those who limit their practices to vascular surgery but would be done or should be done by those having received \u201cadequate\u201d training, presumably in a vascular fellowship. Vascular surgery should also be limited to those who do a sufficient number of vascular cases on an annual basis to maintain competence. It was the hope of Dr. Mannick that referral in most communities would be to those surgeons who have had the training and experience necessary for certification in vascular surgery. He expressed confidence that vascular surgery can be identified as a specialty without abandoning its position within general surgery, and in some instances, thoracic surgery. He pointed out that directors of vascular training programs must bend every effort to ensure that their graduating vascular fellows are skilled and mature vascular surgeons. However, he noted that in providing the training for the vascular surgeons, the program directors must not neglect basic vascular experience in the training of general surgery residents.With this historical review, we are brought back to the concern expressed in my opening statement regarding the fact that vascular surgery is considered a component of general surgery training programs and that any graduate of an approved general surgery training program should be qualified by virtue of his training to manage the spectrum of vascular surgery problems. To provide some comparison and contrast the experience of the new graduate of a general surgery training program with a vascular resident completing a year of fellowship, a survey of vascular surgery training programs was carried out. I also attempted to obtain data concerning vascular surgery experience among graduates of general surgery training programs but learned that through 1985, these reports were destroyed after review for the board examination. Nonetheless, I was informed by an official of the American Board of Surgery of the following information. Of the 1025 operative lists that were reviewed in the 1985 resident cohort, there were 18 general surgery residents who had not performed a single major vascular reconstructive procedure during the course of their residency. The impression was that no more than 20% of the graduating residents had performed 40 major vascular reconstructive procedures during the course of their residency, the number indicated as being appropriate by the Residency Review Committee. Moreover, fully 50% of the residents had only done 10 or fewer major vascular reconstructive procedures during their last two years of residency.It is obvious that there is a considerable spectrum of vascular surgery experience among general surgery residents. However, each resident, on successful completion of a residency and passing the qualifying and certifying examinations for board certification in general surgery, receives the same certificate. There is absolutely no way to tell looking at such a certificate whether one has had reasonable experience, minimal experience, or no experience with vascular surgery. It is conceivable that a graduate of a general surgery program, so certified, could enter a community practice and advertise himself as a \u201cvascular surgeon,\u201d without having ever done a vascular operation; this, by virtue of having completed a general surgery residency and by a statement that vascular surgery is a primary component of a general surgery residency program.In contrast, 32 programs training 44 fellows in vascular surgery, who reported their experience to me for the years 1984 and 1985 provided a considerably different experience. The average number of abdominal aortic aneurysm resections performed by a graduating fellow was 16. The average number of carotid endarterectomies was 28. The average number of aortoiliac reconstructions was 12. The average number of femoropopliteal bypass grafts was 29 (Table I).The average number of category 1 and 2 cases performed by a fellow during a course of a clinical year was 142, with a range from 30 to 351. The number of graduating fellow performing less than 70 cases in this review was only four. The number of fellow performing between 70 and 100 category 1 and 2 cases was 10. The number performing between 101 and 150 was 11, and the number performing greater than 151 was 19 (Table II).The vascular surgery fellow who spends one year of concentrated effort living, breathing, and doing vascular surgery to the extent reported in this survey should develop the maturity of judgment, technical skill, and experience with the length and breadth of the specialty sufficient to enter the practice of vascular surgery under optimal conditions. The suggestion that a general surgeon, fresh out of a residency program, is equally capable as a trained vascular surgeon, can only be described as reductio ad absurdum. There is no question that the granting of surgical privileges in vascular surgery to a new graduate should be limited to those who have had an additional year of training in vascular surgery after completion of a general surgery residency.One might well ask: should the above requirements be extended to established general surgeons doing vascular surgery? The answer to that question is certainly not. There is no doubt that a properly trained general surgeon, over time, can develop sufficient experience to be a skilled vascular surgeon. In days before the establishment of special training programs in vascular surgery, this was the only option. Those who have acquired skills as evidenced by their commitment to vascular surgery, their case volume, and their results are certainly entitled to call themselves vascular surgeons and to continue to practice the specialty as cases are referred. However, to suggest that this pattern be relived in modern times by engaging in self-training as a substitute for a formal vascular fellowship is at the least, anachronistic and at worst, malpractice.With the recognition of the importance of formal training in vascular surgery as a basis to qualify surgeons for the practice of vascular surgery, the question often arises: why should we include vascular surgery in the training of the general surgeon? The answer to that question is that vascular surgical training makes a better and more competent general surgeon. Experience with the mobilization, control, and repair of vascular structures provides the experience and inspires the confidence necessary for the general surgeon to resect organs, work near large vessels, and handle vascular trauma. In addition, the surgeon who completes his training in general surgery may well enter further training in a specialty field in which experience in the handling of vascular structures will form the basis for further expansion of skills. This includes those who go into cardiac surgery, those who wish to take further training in vascular surgery, and those who elect to enter the fields of plastic or transplantation surgery. Reimplantation of extremities, the movement of large free flaps, and other procedures have all been made possible by techniques developed in vascular surgery and are now included in the armamentarium of the plastic surgeon. Likewise, those engaging in transplantation surgery recognize the value of having had experience in handling large vessels and their anastomoses. For these reasons, we must continue to provide excellent training in vascular surgery for the general surgeon, not because we expect him or her to take care of patients with vascular disease but because this experience may well be required in general surgery or the surgeon's subsequent specialty practice.With the establishment of vascular surgery as a recognized specialty and with the concern that other disciplines will soon follow, such as critical care, surgical oncology, and transplantation, this has engendered considerable concern in the general surgery establishment and a tendency to fight inevitable progress in this direction in the name of preventing fragmentation within general surgery. The question often comes up: what is general surgery? The answer to that question is that general surgery represents the core curriculum. A surgeon completing the training in general surgery may wish to enter the general practice of surgery but must understand that there are limitations in his or her training, judgment, and experience. The surgeon finishing a general surgery residency 30 to 40 years ago may well have included the care of orthopedic, urologic, and gynecologic problems, as well as the area commonly recognized as the domain of general surgery today. With the expansion of knowledge and techniques in each of those areas, separate identifiable specialties were created and broke away from general surgery. These include urology, orthopedic surgery, cardiothoracic surgery, and head and neck surgery. Each of these specialties has its own separate training program and its own separate board. Unfortunately, with the exception of cardiothoracic surgery, none of these specialties requires the completion of a full general surgical residency. It is only natural that with increasing knowledge and technical expansion within the \u201ccomponents of general surgery,\u201d that these components will also become separate identifiable disciplines. However, it is important to keep each of these disciplines within the field of general surgery and to require a full general surgery residency training as the background for subspecialization. The knowledge and experience gained with the surgical residency training program continue to be used every day by those who have chosen to limit their practices to one of the components. It is indeed fortunate that the current leadership of the American Board of Surgery is coming to that point of view. At the July 1985 retreat, the board developed and approved a statement regarding specialization and fragmentation.The American Board of Surgery recognized that with the evolution and advancement of medicine, specialization within the art and science of surgery will occur. The board makes a distinction between specialization, which occurs under the continuing aegis of general surgery and articulates with the whole, and fragmentation, which is a separation and disarticulation from the surgical corpus. The board makes this distinction to emphasize the importance of preserving the primary components of surgery and yet recognizes the contributions of specialization to the overall objective of quality care and training. The board believes that this is best achieved by adding qualifications to the surgery certificate and not by creating separate certificates or boards. In keeping with the stated purpose of the board, it is necessary to conduct examinations of candidates who have satisfactorily completed general surgery, and specialty training, and to provide recertification. Maintenance of the American Board of Surgery certificate, including added qualifications, requires recertification both in the central core of knowledge in surgery, and in the specialized body of information specific to added qualifications.Although the implications of the statement made by the American Board of Surgery seem to suggest recognition of the importance of fellowship training as a prerequisite to practice, it stops short of saying so. The Board continues to emphasize the fact that a certificate is not a license. Unfortunately, many hospitals fail to recognize that distinction.In conclusion, I would like to make two specific recommendations. Surgeons who have just completed their training in general surgery must have additional training in vascular surgery if they wish to practice that specialty. I call on the Joint Council of the two societies to establish a committee for purposes of developing a document that will help hospital and operating room committees review candidates with respect to vascular surgery privileges. This document should address applicants who have just completed training with respect to their qualifications in vascular surgery. It will also provide a mechanism for reviewing established surgeons in regard to minimum practice experience and the need for a continuing audit of surgical results.Vascular surgery through the leadership exerted by the vascular societies has accomplished a great deal in the evolution of thinking by the surgical establishment in recognizing the reality of vascular surgery as a specialty and the importance of specialty training under the overall aegis of general surgery. We must avoid the temptation to sit back and enjoy our success to date, for the quest of excellence is a continuing one.",
  "1989": "Being elected president of the Society for Vascular Surgery is a great honor. As you all recognize, it is largely a symbolic office because the president's tenure is very short, and there are very few second terms of office. The amount of power one has in this post is limited and consists of trying to convince one's colleagues that one's ideas for the Society have merit and are worthy of consideration. I have been pleased, indeed honored, to work with our former president, Stanley Crawford, in implementing changes that will continue to ensure the proper place for the Society for Vascular Surgery. A new dedication to our purpose for the field is clearly under way and will benefit all of us.The one formal requirement of this office is to give the presidential address. I and, I suspect, my predecessors have all looked on this task as a difficult one. Perhaps the Society should stop this practice and heed the words of Sam Rayburn who did not believe in giving speeches. He said, \u201cYou can't be asked to comment on something you didn't say.\u201d What can one say that will be remembered? I suspect very little\u2014particularly as it relates to the major problems facing us as individuals and as a profession. Nevertheless, preparing this address forced me to think and rethink many issues that are important to me. I have had to review not only my own professional life but the future of our profession\u2014most particularly as it pertains to an academic life.After considerable thought, I decided to devote this talk to my own experiences and how many of these affected my career. I realize this is presumptuous, but I know this best even though my views are very biased. Simply being here giving this address is proof that I have achieved some success in my endeavors. However, as you all know, being chosen for the position of president cannot occur without having friends in high places. In academic life your work is reflected in your academic rank (except at Harvard). In my case I discovered that for each level of achievement and higher academic rank I was really not much different\u2014just older.I finally came to realize and accept that my place in academic life was to work on the small parts of the puzzles we all face. The challenge of the jigsaw puzzle rests in the hope that by putting the little pieces in place, the big picture will finally emerge. That victory in the solution of major problems is rarely shared by any of us in this profession. Look at the problem of atherosclerosis. Although some of my work has made its detection and quantitation a reality, the impact of this effort on its final solution is at best uncertain. I suspect none of us will be alive when that puzzle is finally put together. Perhaps this is too limited a view of my role, but I think not.For me, there are no other professions outside of medicine that could have brought me to a similar place in time. For example, my professional life has been a whole series of fortunate accidents for which I can claim very little credit. I wanted to be a coach and ended up in medical school. It was my greatest desire to be a family doctor, but I ended up in surgery. I wanted to practice surgery in a fine community I had already picked out but ended up in academic medicine. I intended to pursue research in gastrointestinal disease but became involved in studies of the vascular system. Where did I go wrong?This curious series of events has always fascinated me because it seemed that at key times in my life I was being pulled\u2014often quite violently\u2014in opposite directions. I think it all turned out well, but it has certainly made me wonder about how careers are chosen, and how one succeeds and why another one fails. Those of us in academic life are always attempting to pick the best young men and women for tomorrow. We use their background, family history, academic record, and an interview to arrive at a decision. What would you think of a young man whose well-known father had advanced syphilis? It was also known that he hated his son. His mother was alleged to be constantly slipping between the sheets with men of status. To make things even worse our candidate had an abysmal academic record. To top it off, he walked into the interview smoking a cigar. \u201cI am sorry Mr. Churchill\u2014we don't believe you are qualified for the post.\u201d I have come to the conclusion that success occurs because of a combination of family-taught values and ideals, stubbornness, a modest intellect, and an ability to work hard when others are playing. Let me explain what I mean.What about values and ideals? To what extent do they play a role in our success? Professor Allan Bloom in a challenging and depressing book entitledThe Closing of the American Mindhas commented on many of these issues with particular emphasis on the current generations.This book forced me to reassess my background, and I think it might have a similar effect on you. I will quote him at length because what he says is true, and it is perhaps one of the saddest features of our society. \u201cIn the United States, practically speaking, the Bible was the only common culture, one that united simple and sophisticated, rich and poor, young and old\u2014as the very model for a vision of the order of the whole of things, as well as the key to the rest of Western art, the greatest works of which were in one way or another responsive to the Bible\u2014and provided access to the seriousness of books.\u201dHe goes on to state that we as a society are highly attuned to the concept of a healthy body, but we know virtually nothing about the development of a healthy soul. As he notes, reason cannot establish values, and belief in this is a stupid and pernicious illusion. For psychologists to tell us it is okay to feel guilty and for sociologists to talk about the sacred is, as Professor Bloom states, like a man who keeps an old toothless lion around to experience the thrills of the jungle.Fortunately for me, I was spared many of these problems.I was raised in a Norwegian Lutheran environment where the rules of God and the fallibility of man were continually impressed on me. If you have ever heard Garrison Keillor talk about a Lutheran confirmation, you will know what I am referring to. Even today, I can awake from a deep sleep and recite in order the books of the Bible. The message of the Sermon on the Mount was real for me and remains a constant reminder of how we should treat our fellow man. I was pleased to find out that they erected a statue to the unknown Norwegian in Lake Wobegon.What does this all mean? Living through this period of transition of differing values that Professor Bloom discusses has made me reassess the meaning of my background. Even though I question much of what I was taught, I have not been able to erase its impact on my thinking and my conduct. I strongly believe that the mission of a physician is one of a higher calling, with a level of moral and ethical responsibility that is unique in our society. Although there are many who now question such views and the Judeo-Christian tradition, which is the basis for much of this belief, what is there to offer in its place? Certainly such a background during one's formative years provides one with a large number of prejudices, but a mind that has none is empty. It is much better to have a guilty conscience than no conscience at all.In my case, the ideals taught by my parents and my church are always there as reminders of the greater things I should aspire to but never reach. There is no doubt that these values had the greatest influence on my views toward my work and my patients. No matter how far I stray from these beliefs, they are always there and never go away. I am sure that some of these ideals are as important to many of you, but it is not fashionable to speak of them these days.My role models were an added bonus of my upbringing. This was most evident in my early years with sports figures, and later was extended to teachers, historical figures, and to physicians. I believed that my heroes possessed ideals and standards that I should try to fashion my life after. Why are heroes important? Whether or not you can ever truly emulate their lives, simply trying to follow their example provides you with an intellectual, moral, and ethical genealogy that is unique and satisfying. Good healthy role models are scarce these days, and it is a pity. In my case, my early success was in a large part due to my respect for and the guidance of Dr. Henry Harkins, my first chief. He persuaded me that becoming an academic surgeon was an important goal I could attain, and he would help me to do so. I do not see much of this today. I wish there were more.Stubbornness is a laudable trait. Perhaps other words such asdevotedordedicatedare better terms, but I prefer it as it is. One must in this business stubbornly assume that one's goals are real, attainable, and worthy of the effort. This is very important, because there will be many times when others will share neither your enthusiasm, nor your goals, nor your belief in the value of your work. My own career appears on the surface to be one of steady growth. However, each goal was reached only with considerable effort and was interrupted by valleys of failure and despair. It was during the down times that my stubbornness and convictions kept me going. Possessing a modest intellect was, as it turned out, a great asset for me. I was never an academic superstar, in fact I had to work very hard to reach my goals. I was rarely asked to come to the head of any class because of my achievements. I was elected to Alpha Omega Alpha, but that occurred several years after holding the rank of professor. At the time I was not sure if it was an honor or an insult. Having to work harder than many of my colleagues left me with the knowledge that success for me could only come by this route. I never resented it once I realized the goals that I set for myself were both realistic and worth-while. Work then became fun. However, the transition from being a formal student to a student for life did not come easily. Our dean welcomed us to medical school as \u201cstudents for life.\u201d At the time, the prospect of studying in perpetuity was not very appealing. However, this represented my immaturity at the time and my lack of knowledge about medicine and its challenges. As many of you know, this remains one of the most worrisome aspects of a medical career. If we fulfilled this role\u2014that of students for life\u2014most of the concerns about our competence would disappear.The transition to an academic career was a gradual one as I have noted. As my place in this field evolved and as I have analyzed my successes and failures there have been many lessons I would like to review for the benefit of some of the younger members of our profession. These lessons may have as much relevance to your lives and careers as they did for me.Like many other surgical residents during my time, the decision to spend time in the research laboratory was not voluntary. It was considered a broadening experience that was resented by many of us. I wanted to work with Dr. Harkins in the gastrointestinal research laboratory, but there was no room. I was told that I had been assigned to work in the area of vascular disease\u2014a subject about which I knew nothing and had no interest. I was given strange material to read about indicator dilution curves and methods of measuring flow and told to go to work.Since I knew nothing, I was forced to start from scratch. In trying to generate ideas and projects, I was horrified to find that the only tools available to me were my fingers, eyes, ears, and arteriography. I tried several things that at the time seemed like deadend streets, but in retrospect were very useful. I spent endless hours in the autopsy room dissecting amputated limbs in an attempt to relate the sites of tissue necrosis to the levels and extent of arterial occlusion. There were no definitive answers. I did the same thing with arteriography, but still there were few answers and no solutions to my dilemma. I needed new tools. Where could I look?I decided to turn to our physiologists, who spend their lives measuring things, to see if they could help. The only studies being done of potential value were by a Canadian by the name of Charles Egan, who was measuring blood flow in rabbit ears using a mercury strain gauge. Would it work on fingers and toes?In fact it did, and I spent a year adapting it to these appendages and using it to estimate flow, examine volume pulse waveforms, and measure limb blood pressure. Lesson number one\u2014do not give up too soon, cast your net widely, look outside your own field. Finally, consider adopting other people's approaches to your problem. This was a great year in many respects. I learned that I could accomplish something if I tried hard enough. After I completed my residency, Dr. Harkins helped me get a position as a clinical investigator for the Veterans Administration, but now I was really on my own.My year in research was just a start. Once again I realized that I was over my head. I needed to get more research training and additional experience if I were to succeed as an academic surgeon. Fortunately, there was a 3-month course in biophysics and electronics available that I supplemented with a mathematics tutor. Lesson number two\u2014do not be afraid to get some extra training, it always helps.As a result of this experience I was exposed to the use of ultrasonography that was being developed to measure blood flow in animals. It was immediately apparent to me that this technology would work in the human, and I began some of the early studies in this area. Lesson number three\u2014take advantage of unique situations when they are presented to you. Serendipity is marvelous\u2014take advantage of it.It was also at this stage in my life when I began to try to sell my ideas to my colleagues. How many of you have been there and are there now? I was encouraged to send one of my first papers to a renowned vascular physician for comments. I was sure he would share my enthusiasm for my work, and I looked forward to his constructive comments. His response was devastating to me, both personally and scientifically. I tore the paper literally to shreds, never to see it again.Saul Bellow makes the following observations about this kind of experience\u2014\u201cA piece of writing is an offering. You bring it to the altar and hope it will be accepted. You pray at least that rejection will not throw you into a rage and turn you into a Cain. Those who do not recognize its value now may do so later. It may well be that your true readers are not here as yet, and that your books will cause them to materialize.\u201dFortunately another event occurred at the time that helped restore my confidence. Dr. Geza DeTakats, a man of great warmth and integrity, had seen some of my work. I had the pleasure of meeting him to discuss the direction of these efforts. He seemed so genuinely interested that I felt saved. He even wanted me to keep him informed of the progress of my work. I will always be in debt to him. Lesson number four\u2014there are people in this world who are not threatened by new ideas and are supportive of the work of young investigators.The next hurdles included submitting my work for publication. The problems are bad enough for surgical journals, but try to step outside your specialty, and you find that the problems are often magnified. You think you write well, but no one else does. When submitting manuscripts to a nonsurgical journal, being a surgeon placed you at a disadvantage\u2014they often will not believe you. And yet publishing is the only way we have of communicating with each other, and this is the only mechanism by which we can share ideas.In addition, I believe that although it is difficult, it is essential that we publish some of our best material outside our specialty. Think what the situation might be today if we had followed this course with regard to the issue of carotid endarterectomy. The nonsurgeons in our country will not read our journals\u2014we must take our information to them. This is unfortunate but true. We are often perceived as less than objective and certainly not true scientists. This is changing, and this trend must continue. If we were to educate each other instead of just ourselves, many problems would disappear.One of the more frequent complaints about academia is the \u201cpublish or perish\u201d attitude that exists. Yes, it is there and for good reason\u2014the only efficient way to transmit information is to write. The complaints about publishing usually come from people who publish very little and are too lazy to do so. Part of this difficulty may rest in the fact that it is not easy to write well. When I first began writing papers it was a very discouraging experience, made even worse by the truth of Lord Byron's remark that \u201cGood writing is re-writing.\u201d Surgeons are impatient people and do not like the experience of rewriting a manuscript several times to satisfy the whims of an editor. The reward, of course, is seeing a well written paper with your name on it.What of research in a surgical environment? Are we mere dabblers? Is it worth all the time, effort and money? Should we not simply confine ourselves to that which we do best, surgery? Some of our leading critics in academic general surgery have been vocal about our research, decrying its poor quality and high volume. Yet as vascular surgeons we stand in a unique position in medicine. We don't even yet have a large group of nonsurgical competitors to deal with. The cardiologists have taken over much of the exciting research in heart disease, leaving the academic cardiac surgeon in a weakened position vis-a-vis research. I do not want that to happen to us, and I hope it will never transpire on the same scale. Certainly we need companions but not directors.Research in vascular disease must remain the primary focus for the academic surgeon; without it we will die as a vibrant specialty. It is the one thing that I enjoy the most. It is a very satisfying experience to discover something that no one else is aware of. It is good for one's soul and keeps the interest level high, because there is so much more to do and uncover. The joy of recognizing something that no one before you has appreciated is a wonderful experience. Perhaps we should heed the famous words of Einstein\u2014\u201cGod is slick, but he is not mean.\u201d If we discover the truth, regardless of how small or insignificant it may be, God will not deny us that right or satisfaction.What about success in research and its meaning to you and to me? Most of what I have done in my life is to contribute to the half-way technology described by Lewis Thomas. Yet it is my hope that it may assist in peeling away the layers of the onion as we search for some final answers. Ultimately, and we must never forget this, the answers to many basic biologic questions will have to be verified in the human by careful, objective studies. Perhaps we can find the truth by looking at the problem directly rather than by doing the multimillion dollar clinical endpoint studies that rarely provide an answer. At the present time there is not a single clinical trial under way that is asking questions about the disease process itself, even though we have the tools to do so.Although those in academic life continue to search for solutions to our problems and the diseases we treat, we must never lose sight of the fact that we are doctors first and surgeons second. In the transition and evolution of our knowledge, the welfare of our patients must remain first. We must always strive to do better. This can come about only by continuing to search for the truth through ongoing research. Certainly, we are doing things better and safer than when I started in this field. We understand the physiology better, we can make the diagnosis with more certainty, and we are more objective about the results of therapy. This has come about only because of research designed to answer difficult questions.Yet we must be continually vigilant and accept our role and the problems we all face. Some of our research has not been of the greatest quality. Look at the problems associated with the prosthetic graft. We have been vigorously trying to design the ideal prosthesis with very little success.We have made the walls thinner, bonded heparin to them, changed the pore size, put fuzz on the inside, outside, both sides, and given it an external support. Finally, we are planting cells on the surface to make it look and act like a real blood vessel. The human body is not totally happy with these results. On the positive side, these failures have led to the realization of the importance of the response of the arterial wall to injury and its repair. This new and enlightened approach has already enlisted a new cadre of vigorous young surgeons into an area of research that is going to have enormous benefits for the future of this field. For me, this has been one of the most promising developments in vascular surgery. We are beginning to address the fundamental problems.One of the most difficult aspects of academic life is the need to maintain one's clinical and operating skills. Is there anything worse than to be seen as only a talking surgeon and not a working surgeon? I have tried to maintain my skills and achieve the results expected of me, but it has not been easy. One of the difficult problems in this field is that incompetence is immediately recognized by one's peers and on occasion by one's patients. In vascular surgery the patient is never again the same even if the operation turns out well. If it turns out poorly, the patient is often worse and left with a situation that may not be correctible. This is a terrible prospect for the patient and for the surgeon; it can be a bitter defeat.Although few of us have done things to adversely affect history, the surgical outcome for Sir Anthony Eden clearly illustrates how a mishap not only affected his life but history as well.He needed to go into the hospital to have his gall bladder removed. According to his biographer, Eden's response to the notion was, \u201cI have to go into a nursing home for a tiresome operation, not dangerous, for my gall bladder! Isn't it stupid? But they all say I shall be the better for it.\u201dAccording to his biographer he was operated on by an experienced surgeon whose name is not given. Eden's bile duct was accidentally cut. He was told later, \u201cThe knife slipped.\u201d A clear blunder! A second operation was required. The biographer records, \u201c... his life had been saved by the energy and skill of a junior surgeon and his team\u2014it had been a very close thing.\u201d Fate can be very cruel and seldom more so than it was to Anthony Edein in 1953. He had lost his health and his premiership as a direct result of a medical mistake. This story has many threads one can use to weave a whole series of tales we can relate to.The lessons from this example are clear. Imagine how many similar tales are played out daily in our society where we continue to struggle with the issue of competence. It is most unfortunate that although we recognize incompetence within our ranks we continue to act as if it did not exist. The struggle by the late Jack Wylie is a case in point. He did not want vascular surgery identified as a speciality for our own gratification. He felt strongly that patients with vascular disease deserved better treatment than they were getting, and he was right.Why do surgeons undertake tasks for which they are not properly trained? Getting in over one's head in vascular surgery is a very unpleasant experience. Do we have to tolerate this simply to please those who are opposed to the concept of vascular surgery as a discipline? Our patients and the hospitals in which we work are beginning to say no, and it is time we listen more closely. We must be the patients' advocate and not their adversary.The perceived need for extra training in vascular surgery was vigorously resisted by our General Surgery colleagues. The fact is that general surgery, as I knew it and you know it, is in serious trouble. Everyone knows it, but it has only been recently that the leaders in the field have begun to discuss the changes that are needed. We all hope that it will not die a slow death as the forces for change pass it by. With few exceptions those general surgeons who want to do vascular surgery should have extra training.As an academician, I am involved in the training of vascular fellows and working with them has been one of the more rewarding experiences of my career. When I look at them in practice, I realize they have talents that I do not possess. In fact, most of them have demonstrated the two qualities most important for a successful career\u2014a true love of their patients and the desire to do the best possible job. This makes our job much easier and also provides assurance to the public that our product is one we can all be proud of and that they can trust. In a nutshell, this is the essence of good medicine and exactly what we need at this time in our profession.Like all of you, I am here because of the influences of many people. My success has been possible only because of the help and support of my family and friends. My patients, my wife, and children must take a great deal of the credit for my success. Without their support it would not have been possible. As Goethe said, \u201cIf you remove from me what I owe to other people, there would be little left.\u201dI also want to thank all of the trainees, residents, fellows, and technologists I have had the pleasure of working with. Thank you for a job well done. You have added immeasurably to my professional and personal life, and I will always be grateful for that experience.There are people in my life to whom I am particularly grateful, and I would like to acknowledge them at this time. First, there is David Sumner, whose intellect and honesty have no match. His friendship and scholarly approach to everything he does will always be admired and respected by me.Mr. Gene Hokanson came into my professional life at a special and unique time. He was the first non-physician I ever hired, and he proved to me how good ideas can be put to practice if you put your mind to it. When I let Bob Barnes join our group I was not sure what I was getting into. His vigor and enthusiasm were infectious, as was his constant reminder that he was going to make me famous. I appreciated that, but even more important he came to Seattle on his own to counsel me at a difficult time in my professional life. This is something I will never forget.In my residency I made a friend who is the most generous human being I have ever known. Dr. Richard Schultz of Omaha has been a true and loyal friend throughout my professional life. I had to go to far away places to meet the next two people who have had an impact on my life. Dr. Marc Cairols of Barcelona, Spain, has an appreciation of the meaning of life, medicine, and people that I will always admire.Finally, Dr. Brian Thiele, an import from Australia, is in many ways my sounding board for ideas. He is a surgeon's surgeon, who understands better than most the role of excellence. He has a view for the future that most of us will never have. Our friendship continues to grow.Thank you to all of you. Our lives, careers, successes, and failures are all enmeshed in our friendships, which have stood the test of time.",
  "1990": "During the first 25 years of the contemporary development of vascular surgery, standards were set by a few pioneers. Indications for operation were determined sometimes by meager knowledge of the life history of specific vascular disease. Great emphasis was placed on technical matters. Centers concentrated on specific areas of interest resulting in the evolvement of a set of standards.A check and balance system was created during this quarter century by several outstanding pioneers in the field of vascular surgery. They constantly questioned techniques and results. They were striving for excellence and openly criticized expediency and mediocrity. The rapid spread of information through journals and meetings such as this opened the door for the care of major vascular disease in every hospital in the United States.In the 1950s and 1960s, a handful of leaders and institutions set the standards for patient care, research, and education methods used in the care of patients with vascular disease. This was a time of rapid growth and accumulation of knowledge. It was sometimes done without adequate controls as the need to develop techniques and treat an ever-increasing number of patients took precedence over well-established scientific approaches to patient care.In 1974 a committee from the Society for Vascular Surgery consisting of H. Edward Garrett, Edwin J. Wylie, and James A. DeWeese published a preliminary report on vascular surgical guidelines for screening.This very thorough report was intended to provide assistance to local area committees in establishing guidelines for screening in the practice of vascular surgery. It established norms of selection, evaluation, hospital days, and specific tests that were to be subject to local deviation subject to professional judgement. If it had been widely used and periodically reviewed by this society and its members a truly lasting standard would have been set.Now, 16 years later, we have developed and refined surgical techniques to repair defects in all arteries of the body and have begun to apply these same efforts to repair major defects in the venous system. We must guard against expediency over continued careful development of our discipline. With our great technical ability, we are tempted to become more involved with doing than thinking. We must not take a \u201cMt. Everest\u201d mentality\u2014fix them because they are there. Should we operate on mild claudication? Although it is easy to fix with apparent excellent results, is surgery always necessary? Do we seek comparisons between operative and nonoperative therapy? Is thought given to the natural history of disease?Although this attitude is not common, it is currently being used by the entrepreneur in the use of new technology. Laser-assisted balloon angioplasty and the atherectomy catheter are examples where relatively small lesions of the superficial femoral artery are being treated because they are present with mild symptoms. This is done at great cost to the patient both in money and, at times, in multiple operative procedures and even amputation. With few exceptions there is no thought for careful study to thoroughly evaluate such techniques. This disturbing approach, without controls, does not usually improve patient care and may have disturbing negative effects. It raises the cost of care, thereby discrediting our profession and casting a heavy shadow on all new technology.The cost factor creates immediate difficulty with the U.S. government and all third party carriers. This \u201creward now, pay later\u201d mentality promotes studies like that of Hsiao et al.The end result may be the relegation of the surgeon to the category of a mechanic. Surgeons stand a good chance of being reimbursed in the future for piecework\u2014not as thoughtful, careful internists with the added ability to correct defects by operative intervention.There is much concern on the part of third party payors as to indication, quality, and outcome of care. It is obvious that these organizations, particularly the U.S. government through Medicare, are going to delineate criteria of patient selection, type of care, and long-term follow-up. Although this is already happening, it is still in its infancy. Past experience has shown us that if someone else sets these standards, patient care may suffer, and it will surely take a long time to rectify any errors. For the first time we will have to work closely with our hospitals. Third party carriers are insisting on total package pricing. The old system, basic cost plus extras, will not be accepted. An extension of reimbursement like that in diagnosis related groups (DRGs) will be the foundation for the next decade.The surgical profession\u2014and particularly the Society for Vascular Surgery\u2014should set a high priority on developing methods of participation in how these payments are made. Unless we act and participate in setting these standards, we are likely to be relegated to the position of an auto mechanic: Each procedure has its cost with little thought given to the time consuming cognitive effort involved in the care of the patient. We will have to pay great attention to the perioperative care of the very ill patient. We are irresponsible if we simply add what appear to be fair extra dollars to the patient care process without thorough evaluation and cost cutting wherever this can be done safely and effectively. Allowances must be made for the unavoidable complications that sometimes occur and may even necessitate a second or third operative procedure. Since the practice of surgery, particularly vascular surgery, is an inexact science, who is better qualified than we to delineate the incidences of complication and their costs?Another negative effect may have even broader reaching consequences. New technologic advances must be nurtured and carefully developed because they will change the way we practice vascular surgery. New advances in technology must constantly be evaluated, changed, and made more practical in the patient care process. There must be prospective studies comparing new and old procedures. Only then can one accurately compare and develop new techniques for the care of patients with vascular disease. Leadership in the development and evaluation of new technologies must be provided by the membership of the Society for Vascular Surgery.We have been challenged by several reports that have delineated a poor selection process and poor results of therapy. This has been particularly true in the area of carotid endarterectomy. The first Rand report stated an extremely high mortality and morbidity rate.This appeared in the national media, much to the our embarrassment. A second such study of carotid endarterectomy is underway at the present time. Soon to follow will be a study of abdominal aortic aneurysm resection and undoubtedly other studies involving occlusive vascular disease.Our goal as a Society is to constantly strive for excellence in the treatment of patients with vascular disease; to improve patient care and refine techniques. If we are to meet this goal, we should establish standard criteria for operation, morbidity, and mortality rate for all commonly treated vascular problems. We must pool our resources as a Society and accurately delineate standards of patient care. This process has begun with the appointment of the Society of Vascular Surgery's Ad Hoc Committee on Quality Assurance and Clinical Research. The committee's preliminary reports were given as a portion of our Special Day on Issues.Nothing is static. Disease patterns change, techniques change, the entire complexity of the patient care process changes. We may have been guilty in the past of complying with the old adage \u201cIf it ain't broke, don't fix it.\u201d I would offer that it is broken, that to not constantly reassess is the path to mediocrity. I would submit as an example vascular prostheses. We seem to be content with Dacron and Gore-Tex as they roll off the various assembly lines. We and our partners in industry must push for better arterial substitutes. Vascular surgeons need to be in the forefront to protect our patients, the hospitals in which we practice, and our profession.ResearchResearch throughout the past 4 decades in vascular surgery has taken many forms. Much would only fit loosely in the definition of research as it has been in the form of clinical retrospective studies. Early, this was helpful to refine techniques and criteria of patient care. Little effort has been exerted nationally by vascular surgeons to insist on high-quality clinical research and even less effort has been demonstrated in the area of basic research to delineate and modify the causes of and changes produced by occlusive vascular disease. Monies emanating from the National Institutes of Health granted to surgeons for the study of these problems are indeed at a low ebb. These monies are being granted to other disciplines. This trend, if it continues, will relegate the vascular surgeon to a low status.In recent years this Society, through the efforts of its members, has begun a process of reversal of these trends. The yearly conference sponsored by the Society for Vascular Surgery\u2014Research Initiatives in Vascular Disease\u2014is one such element that is adding, and will add, materially to our ability to foster basic research within our specialty. The formation of the Society for Vascular Surgery Lifeline Foundation is another method of encouraging and rewarding research in the area of the cause and treatment of vascular disease. Although these efforts are without question a very positive step, we should not rest on our oars. Proposals set forth by our Ad Hoc Committees on Quality Assurance and Clinical Research should involve all of us in some form of clinical research. This will not only answer difficult questions about the clinical care of patients, but will set standards that have not been set before.EducationEducation is perhaps our noblest obligation. Techniques, curriculum contents, and goals need to constantly be evaluated and changed to ensure success. In 1970 Dr. Jack Wylie pointed out the deficiencies in our vascular training programs. Since then a base of checks and balances has been laid to ensure the adequacy of training. Imperfections are still present in our system of education. This is demonstrated by the failure rates on the vascular board examinations\u201417.9% on written and 19.3% on oral examination in 1988. Since the written examination questions are composed by persons from the vascular surgical community, and the oral examinations are given in a prescribed manner by members of this Society, should we not have a higher passing rate? As the examinations are so carefully written and monitored for content and fairness, one can only look at the educational process.Education of a vascular surgeon is time consuming. There are no short cuts. The demands thrust on the productive program director may markedly detract from time at home. Perhaps there are too many repetitive courses and textbooks. When he or she is present, things are always rushed because time is precious. When we take away or modify the expertise at home, quality, innovativeness, and continued technical expertise suffer. If we are to have training program, great sacrifices are necessary for success. Trainees become imbued with \u201cJust be around long enough to show me how\u2014do not tell me why.\u201d The correction of great physiologic changes go undiscussed and are often left to other disciplines such as pulmonologists and cardiologists and maybe vascular internists for resolution. The vascular surgeon must be conversant in all the ramifications of vascular disease. If not, other disciplines will move in to fill that void. We need to produce new vascular surgeons with marked improvements in each generation. This is a commitment that cannot be altered or reduced. Excellence in the total patient care process must be emphasized and imparted to each and every new vascular surgeon.To ensure success part of the approval process of the Residency Review Committee should be past performance records on board examinations of individual training programs. An unacceptable failure rate by trainees in a program should require immediate change or discontinuation of that program. There must be a strong commitment for the future in our training programs.As we enter the decade of the 1990s, the challenges appear to be great. Standards of patient selection and standards of care must be made. Methods for constant surveillance and change of these standards must be maintained. Reimbursement issues must be addressed. We must foster all forms of research. Education must be improved.This new decade, then, brings us many challenges, but at the same time many opportunities. We are capable of surmounting any obstacle. With a dedication to high standards and active participation by all members of the Society, both in clinical research and in education, we can ensure our success in helping our young people develop techniques and standards of excellence. There is no question in my mind that this Society not only has a bright future, but can set the standards that will carry us into the next century.",
  "1991": "It is with profound gratitude and humility that I address you today. I am thankful for the privilege of being president of the oldest society in North America dedicated to vascular surgery. I am also humbled by the knowledge that many of you are far more deserving of this honor than I, and I am further humbled after reviewing the distinguished list of past presidents, the giants of vascular surgery.Society has provided me the privilege of being a surgeon. What other profession affords the satisfaction of helping your fellow human, having fun doing it, and also being paid for it? None that I know of. Therefore I am not only indebted to you my family, friends, residents, students, and colleagues but to society as well.PastWhen I was reflecting on and considering various topics for this presentation, the responsibility became all the more formidable after reading the 41 previous presidential addresses. Three, for various reasons, were not given or published, but the other 41 covered wide-ranging topics. Twenty-one were mainly scientific. Those of the earliest years, not surprisingly, dealt with venous diseases, since arterial reconstruction and cardiac surgical procedures had not yet been performed or perfected. Then came the cardiac surgery explosion of the 1950s and 1960s, which compelled 11 presidents to present cardiac surgical papers, beginning with Blalock in his 1952 address.It is curious that although the early 1950s heralded the dawn of vascular surgery, and seminal discoveries and innovative procedures were being pioneered by our presidents, over the past 44 years only three presidents discussed arterial disease, the first being Linton in 1955.Four presidents presented historical perspectives of the Society for Vascular Surgery, and seven addresses were philosophic.Although biomedical science comprised 17 of the first 20 published presidential addresses, only 3 of the last 21 were scientific reports. This may reflect the maturing of the Society for Vascular Surgery and our becoming involved in societal issues as a result of and in response to contemporary pressures, since eight presidents addressed the issues of training and certification, all within the past 20 years. These presidents including Drs. Wiley F. Barker, James A. DeWeese, F. William Blaisdell, John A. Mannick, H. Edward Garrett, Anthony M. Imparato, Wesley S. Moore, and William J. Fry provided much of the leadership during the intermittently tumultuous times of acquiring specialty status and certification by the American Board of Surgery for General Vascular Surgery.Parenthetically, the Society for Vascular Surgery along with the North American Chapter of the International Society for Cardiovascular Surgery should take great pride in the realization that since 1984 the addresses have been published in the Journal of Vascular Surgery an SVS/ISCVS-Mosby-Year Book, Inc. jointly owned and highly successful periodical.Although the bylaws of the Society emphasize the need \u201cTo promote the study and research in vascular diseases,\u201d it is both curious and disappointing that only four presidents emphasized need for supporting research, beginning with the 1968 address by Dr. Wilfred G. Bigelow, the only Canadian to hold the office of president.Since then Drs. Andrew Glenn Morrow, Allan D. Callow, and most recently D. Eugene Strandness, Jr. have stressed the need to promote research.Strandness noted, \u201cResearch in vascular disease must remain a primary focus for the academic surgeon; without it we will die as a vibrant specialty.\u201dCallow wrote, \u201cWhat is needed is knowledge and such knowledge will be provided by the young among us and those yet to come.\u201dAddressing funding for research Callow suggested, \u201c\u2026we must not depend exclusively on the NIH to provide us with our funds. We must seek other sources.\u201dI will expand on this theme because I firmly believe that we must be producers of surgical knowledge not simply consumers of it. Production of surgical knowledge by supporting and nurturing surgeon-scientists and then applying that knowledge with humanism is, in my view, our obligation to society for the privilege of being surgeons. Humanistic application of knowledge acquired through research is how the Society for Vascular Surgery can best perpetually serve society.PresentSocietal concernsAlthough I have chosen humanism and the nurturing of surgeon-scientists for this essay as the two pivotal issues on which we should collectively focus and expend most of our energies and resources, because only they assure the most lasting and long-term benefits, many other pressing societal issues merit our individual consideration. Dr. C. Everett Koop, the former Surgeon General of the United States, in his lecture to the 1990 Clinical Congress of the American College of Surgeons cited several such issues.Some concerns are \u201ccheap shots\u201d by the misinformed, misguided, and arrogant media.Some of the media \u201cdoctor bashing,\u201d however, may be justified, particularly that relating to Peer Influenced Group Seminars (PIGS), which are nothing more than minivacations disguised as continuing medical education courses sponsored by industry. Equally concerning are conflicts of interest and industrial marketing techniques, preoccupation with fees and unbundled billing practices, abuses of noninvasive vascular laboratory testing such as performing and billing for three tests when only one can be justified, entrepreneurial surgeons who self-servingly tout unproven treatments, and advertising.Concern for physician reimbursement reforms probably consumes more of our Society's energies than is warranted, considering that vascular surgical costs are such a minuscule element in the $650 billion health care expenditure equation and also considering that we are well represented in Washington D.C. by the American College of Surgeons.Society is furious over the estimated 22% administrative costs of health care spending, and associated mismanagement, waste, and fraud. Further agitating society is the lack of affordable quality health coverage for an estimated 33 to 37 million Americans who are virtually uninsured. Added to the ineffectiveness of Medicare and Medicaid programs are fraudulent health insurance practices where patients' premiums are collected but hospital and doctor bills are never paid.Research and publication fraud are also attracting societal concerns, exemplified by the extraordinary cases of the prestidigations and fabrications of Drs. Darsee and Slutsky.In addition, excessive and frivolous disbursement of indirect monies intended to support research are equally troubling.Another issue gaining public attention that requires thoughtful resolution is that of the surgeon impaired by health defects, drugs, or alcohol. Society has been led to believe that significant surgeon impairment results from working too many hours a day. What has not been adequately emphasized is that restrictive work practices preclude continuity of care. Lack of continuity of care, I suggest, will lead to many more mistakes and adverse outcomes than overwork.Harassment by managed care administrators and \u201cpeer\u201d review organizations detracts from our patient care efforts by consuming valuable time with paperwork and nonproductive committee meetings. Health outcomes analyses without risk stratification also impair optimal patient care. Medical liability issues and the practice of defensive medicine clearly increase health care costs and are receiving needed but limited attention through tort reform legislation. Such added costs are receiving societal scrutiny with the looming specter of rationing of medical care. But will rationing be by age, disease, severity of disease, or ability to pay? Will euthanasia be an alternative? Easy answers are not forthcoming.These are the many but by no means all of the societal issues challenging medicine for solutions. What should be the response of the Society for Vascular Surgery to this litany of concerns? I suggest that the answer may be found in \u201cThe Boundaries of Medicine,\u201d Dr. Donald Seldon's 1980 presidential address to the Association of American Physicians when he cautioned physicians and surgeons not to venture outside the boundaries of our competence.That is not to say that we should not be concerned and involved, but just because surgery and medicine have made dramatic and major technological advances, such advances do not confer infallibility on us. We must guard against the medicalization of society as the solution to all human problems. We must leave solutions to the problems of poverty, drug abuse, starvation, and murder to others in our society such as economists, anthropologists, sociologists, political scientists, and even politicians. As vascular surgeons we must resist the temptation to medicalize society, because such medicalization requires resources beyond our capacities. As Seldon noted, \u201cThe economic, social, and cultural structure of society influences health profoundly. However, this influence is exerted through forces over which medicine has little control and cannot alter. Admittedly, disturbances in political, economic, and social organization may express themselves in serious medical disability, yet the causes generating these illness lie outside the arena of medicine.\u201dI suspect that most, if not all, of the socioeconomic issues cited will ultimately be solved with or without vascular surgery's input, and will be replaced with a new list of issues. But nonetheless, 10 years hence today's concerns will be of historical interest only. Such transient but important issues, in which we should be individually involved to some degree, are largely political whims motivated by economic expediency, and they change from year to year. Collectively we must be careful not to dilute our efforts by addressing tasks we are not prepared for either by experience and knowledge or resources.Our focus should be not on how these problems affect us, but how they affect our patients. Attacking such issues without enlisting patient (society's) support is self serving, and all such efforts are doomed to fail. We should focus on what we know and do best, which is to care for the patient with diligence and humanism and advance the science and perpetuation of vascular surgery through research.HumanismIt is both ironic and disturbing that in the country with the best medical care in the world, medicine and physicians in particular are losing the respect of society. In a recent AMA public opinion poll, almost 60% of Americans responded, \u201cdoctors don't care about people as much as they used to,\u201d and almost two thirds responded, \u201cdoctors are too interested in making money.\u201dSuch societal dismay is embodied in the opening sentence of Charles Dickens'1859 book,A Tale of Two Citieswhere he wrote,\u201cIt was the best of times, it was the worst of times, it was the age of wisdom, it was the age of foolishness, it was the epoch of belief, it was the epoch of incredulity, it was the season of Light, it was the season of Darkness, it was the spring of hope, it was the winter of despair, we had everything before us, we had nothing before us, we were all going direct to heaven, we were all going direct the other way-\u2026\u201dThis nineteenth century quotation has become a twentieth century reality, and we are victims of our own successes. Late twentieth century technology has separated the surgeon from the patient and has in effect dehumanized care. Society, although impressed by our technological accomplishments and grateful for the results provided by such advances, is increasingly disenchanted by our lack of humanism.Dr. Frederick A. Coller, who had great influence on me during medical school at the University of Michigan, in his 1950 American College of Surgeons presidential address emphasized humanism as central to exemplary and optimal patient care.Lack of humanism in 1991 may be the main reason why society views physicians with cynicism and suspicion.Humanism means different things to different people. Random House dictionary defines it as, \u201cA mode of thought or action in which human interests, values, and dignity are taken to be of primary importance.\u201dWebster's Third New International dictionary defines it as, \u201cDevotion to human welfare, interest in or concern for man.\u201dHumanism is not the wringing of hands, raising false hopes, and providing reassurance when none is warranted. Humanism does, however, embrace mutual trust, honesty, altruism, compassion, and knowledge of the patient, his disease, and his family. Sensitivity to our patients' needs, minimizing waiting, respect for their dignity and privacy, respect for their right of choice, and meeting patients' and their families' desires for information embodies the humanistic approach to vascular surgery.Many would attempt to dehumanize vascular surgical care, some unintentionally because they are poorly informed and others because of entrepreneurial commercially driven incentives. Dehumanization is exacerbated by the media advertising things that we surgeons cannot deliver. It is not uncommon that the media, in their zeal to report results from theNew England Journal of Medicineon the evening news, misrepresent or perhaps unwittingly provide half-truths that sound like spectacular breakthroughs, which only later prove to be unsubstantiated or disproved as new data come to light. Misleading information is epitomized by marketers employed by hospitals or physician groups to extol the virtues of a treatment or professional capability simply to gain a \u201cbusiness\u201d edge over competitors. It is clear that marketers market marketing, that is their job. But inevitably, society becomes disappointed, and physicians and surgeons, not the media or marketers, are held responsible and accountable for failures of treatment. We must not allow our patients to be misled by unrealistic media hype and marketing that imply infallibility. Unrealistic expectations promulgated by aggressive or misinformed media must be reviewed by surgeons and vigorously refuted when necessary. However, only through communication, education, and cooperation and not confrontation can this be accomplished. Unless we effectively address this issue, all will lose, patients will be disappointed, and skeptical and surgeons will lose the respect and confidence of society. Humanism does not include entrepreneurism. Dr. Frank Spencer's admonition, that the physician cannot be a double agent serving both the patient and the marketplace, must be heeded.Dehumanization is further exacerbated by managed care administrators and entrepreneurs when they refer to patients as \u201cclients,\u201d \u201cconsumers,\u201d or \u201ccustomers\u201d and physicians as \u201cproviders,\u201d \u201chealth care workers,\u201d or \u201ccare givers.\u201d Surgeons, in particular, are demeaned and should take great exception to being referred to as \u201cproceduralists\u201d or \u201ctechnicians,\u201d connotations that have been perceived to separate us from our patients. Parenthetically, we are as much to blame as anyone for the perception that we are nonthinking technicians and nonhumanists when we demean our specialty by equating \u201coperation\u201d with \u201csurgery.\u201d To me it is heretical to \u201ctake a patient to surgery\u201d and to do \u201csurgery\u201d or \u201csurgerize\u201d the patient or perform \u201csurgeries.\u201dSuch misuse of the word \u201csurgery\u201d relegates us to the status of a technician and moves us from a profession to a trade with corresponding lack of humanism and ethics.It is clear that vascular surgeons are much more than tradesmen who by definition have little opportunity to display humanism. Few, if any other specialties, have the breadth and scope of vascular surgery that encompasses preoperative, operative, and postoperative care and long-term follow-up. With rare exceptions, vascular surgeons are vascular physicians as well because we have no medical reciprocal as the nephrologist to urologist, neurologist to neurosurgeon, gastroenterologist to abdominal surgeon, and cardiologist to cardiac surgeon. Most emphatically, we do not require our patients to be \u201ccleared for surgery\u201d but collaborative consultation may occasionally be required. For the most part, however, we can do it all! Consequently, as complete physician-surgeons we have the great privilege and opportunity to express our humanism to patients.Therefore we must emphasize humanism at all levels of training. We must serve as role models of humanism so that our students, residents, and fellows will not be obsessed with technology and computer printouts to the neglect of the patient, as recently chronicled by the late Dr. Leslie E. Rudolph in his presidential address to the Southeastern Surgical Congress.It is regrettable that some surgical specialists have abrogated their humanistic responsibilities by allowing alleged \u201ccognitivist\u201d colleagues to manage most of the patient's care and virtually \u201cdraw the dotted line\u201d on which the surgeon should cut and to which he should be restricted. Vascular surgery is and must remain a \u201cbody contact sport.\u201d Touching, listening, being compassionate, and even being philosophical and metaphysical about illness so that we are not perceived as cold-hearted technocrats will help restore humanism to surgical care.Humanism is the glue that binds the art to the science of surgery, it is the essence of surgery. It not only binds us closer to our patients but our students, residents, colleagues, and families as well. Humanism makes us more compassionate and instills humility and helps us not to take ourselves so seriously. Vascular surgeons, because we are physician and surgeon in one, have a mandate to provide leadership and serve as humanistic role models. We must reaffirm and rededicate ourselves to humanistic medicine and become a trinity of physician-surgeon-humanist (Fig. 1).More than 60 years ago, Dr. Francis W. Peabody, a scientist who established the Thorndike Memorial Research Laboratory at the Boston City Hospital, noted, \u201cOne of the essential qualifies of the clinician is interest in humanity, for the secret of the care of the patient is in caring for the patient.\u201dPeabody also warned that scientific progress would erode the importance of humanism. And it may have. Our challenge is to reverse this perception and instill both humanism and scientific investigation into our training programs at the earliest possible opportunity. Vascular surgery is uniquely qualified to fulfill this obligation to society.FutureResearchAre humanism and technological advances through research mutually exclusive? Absolutely not! Humanism and commitment to the patient to cure his disease, because he is a human being to whom the physician is inexorably bonded, stimulates creative thinking. Humanism was the stimulus for the development of the heart-lung machine by one of our past presidents, Dr. John H. Gibbon, Jr. It is clear that a strong connection exists between humanism and scientific research driven by humanistic concern and commitment to the patient.The Society for Vascular Surgery was inseminated during a meeting of the Southern Surgical Association in Hot Springs, Va., on Dec. 5, 1945, when Dr. Ross Veal met with Drs. Arthur Allen, Isaac Bigger, Arthur Blakemoore, Barney Brooks, Mims Gage, and George Lilly. This informal discussion culminated in an organizational conference held in San Francisco on July 3, 1946, at which time the Society for Vascular Surgery was born. The first annual meeting took place on June 8, 1947, in Atlantic City. Dr. Geza de Takats who was the recorder of the new society, listed as the first objective, \u201cTo promote research and study in vascular disease.\u201d Consequently, 44 years ago, almost to this day, the need was recognized to promote research and provide a forum for surgeon-scientists to report their research findings on vascular diseases.Advancing our discipline and providing a lasting legacy for our patients and those vascular surgeons yet to come can only be assured through research, either clinical or bench. Without such initiatives, vascular surgery, will cease to exist. Vascular surgeon-scientists are best able to bridge the gap between bench research and pragmatic clinical applications of such research. Clinical research also is absolutely essential to provide answers that come only from studying the human animal. To this end, leadership and participation in well designed randomized clinical trials must be encouraged. The Society for Vascular Surgery has already provided leadership in clinical investigation by establishment of the Randomized Clinical Trials Committee and the Committee on Reporting Standards for clinical investigations.However, beyond establishment of committees and moral support for research by the Society for Vascular Surgery, something more tangible is required. To maintain and increase vascular surgery's cutting edge in research, our long-term commitment and obligation to society, it is essential that young surgeon-scientists be nurtured. We must heed Dr. Owen H. Wangensteen's admonition to the American Surgical Association when he noted, \u201c\u2026 For our discipline's continuing advance, surgery needs future Teachers, anxious to create an atmosphere that will encourage research and creative scholarship. \u2026\u201dUnfortunately, vascular surgical research may be in serious jeopardy because the surgeon-scientist is becoming extinct as a result of an inadequate nurturing milieu. Reflecting this lack of nurturing of surgeon-scientists is the decrease in the number of MD-postdoctoral traineeships and fellowships awarded by the National Heart Lung and Blood Institute (NHLBI) since 1965.Furthermore, this decline continues. Only 20 of 70 applicants in the physician-scientist category received funded research career awards in 1989.That only 20 such individuals were identified, nationwide, is both discouraging and alarming. These trends are ominous and must be reversed by developing strategies and mechanisms to enhance funding for research-training and development, because decline in research awards to physician-scientists will most assuredly hasten the extinction of this endangered species.Indebtedness of our young medical school graduates deters pursuit of an academic career thereby decreasing the pool of potential surgeon-scientists. In 1988, 83.4% of all medical school graduates had some indebtedness which averaged more than $38,000.More than $50,000 was owed by 24% of graduates, and it has been documented that most defer payment until after training.To students and residents so encumbered by debt, private practice beckons with its perceived economic advantages.Student-resident indebtedness and an NIH budget maintaining the status-quo portend serious consequences for the future of vascular surgeon-scientists. These developments also adversely affect industry by shifting potential MD-scientists to law and business careers and decreasing the innovative ideas that generate patents, as has occurred in prosthetic vascular graft development. It is clear that aLifelineis needed to reverse this trend. We must not depend only on one source for funding and nurturing young surgical investigators. Dr. Allan Callow emphasized this in his 1986 presidential address when he suggested that other avenues for funding must be sought since our present system of funding biomedical research appears tenuous.Alternative and additional funding sources will provide training to the surgeon-scientist who desires to make a commitment to research. It will also enhance his ability to compete with PhDs for limited federal funds. In addition, we must try to influence NIH administrative policies so they are modified to facilitate cofunding from other sources and to provide funding from more than one source for separate, nonoverlapping aspects of the same research project.To this end, philanthropic foundations have been established to supplement and often substitute for lack of societal responsibility to nurture clinician-scientists. The Mosley Funds of Harvard, the Kirby Funds at Penn, and the Fund for Henry Ford Hospital are examples of institutional sources of support. On a more global scale are the Fulbright Awards and the now phased out Markle Scholar Program. The American College of Surgeons and the American Heart Association also address these needs. Numerous surgical specialty societies also have developed foundations to nurture surgical-scholars and collectively provide awards totaling approximately $550,000 per year.Included among surgical society funding agencies with annual dollars allocated are the American College of Surgeons ($100,000), American Society of Colon and Rectal Surgeons ($90,000), American Association of Neurological Surgeons ($87,500), American Society of Transplant Surgeons ($45,000), American Surgical Association ($35,000), American Association for the Surgery of Trauma ($35,000), and the Surgical Infection Society (535,000) to name a few. The Society for Vascular Surgery has been conspicuous by its absence among these organizations listed in the American College of Surgeons bulletin.That such foundation support is justified by accomplishments by awardees is apparent from data summarizing the academic productivity of the Markle Scholarship Program, which invested 16 million dollars over 25 years in 506 scholars, 96% of whom remained in academia.This program provided early support for 101 academic surgeons.Even modest research-training programs have had substantial impact on nurturing academic surgeons. Witness the results from academic surgery training grants provided between 1959 and 1965 through the NIH by a mandate from the National Advisory Health Council. Seven university departments of surgery including Duke, Harvard, Michigan, Pennsylvania, University of Washington, Washington University, and Utah received these Training Grants for Academic Surgeons which supported 52 trainees. Eighty-seven trainee years were funded at the modest cost of slightly more than 1 million dollars. The academic productivity of this program was striking in that 20 years later, more than 60% of trainees remained in academic surgery.Apparently, such support left an indelible impression on these young surgeon-scientists during their most impressionable years.Lifeline FoundationTo provide additional funding for young surgical-investigators, the Society for Vascular Surgery Lifeline Foundation was established as a tax-exempt subsidiary, in 1986 and serves as the education and research organ of the Society. During the past 5 years, organizational objectives and fund-raising strategies have been developed. Many of you have generously, contributed to the Foundation and along with funds allocated and pledged by the Society for Vascular Surgery, and industry, more than $600,000 have been pledged to fund deserving research by young surgical investigators. I am delighted to announce that as of this meeting the Lifeline Foundation will begin inviting applications for Lifeline Grant Awards. The deadline for receipt of applications is Jan. 15, 1992. Awards will be announced and become effective July 1, 1992. A grant awards committee will review competitive applications. It is anticipated that two grants will be awarded annually totalling $50,000 each to include indirect costs. Each award will be for 1 year with the option to extend for an additional year. The awards are intended for surgeons who have completed their formal surgical education in general surgery and who have completed or are in an advanced training program in vascular surgery. They should be certified by the American Board of Surgery or have completed the requirements for certification. Although successful passage of the American Board of Surgery Examination in General Vascular Surgery is not required at the time of application, it is expected that such certification will be obtained. Applications should be submitted within 3 years of completion of an approved residency or training program. The applicant must have either a faculty appointment in an approved medical school in the United States or Canada, or have received an academic appointment within the guidelines of the applicant's institution. Grant awards are not intended to supplement salary, which will remain the responsibility of the institution in which the awardee holds an appointment. It is expected that the recipient will devote a significant amount of time to the funded project. A progress report will be presented by the investigator during the annual meeting of Society for Vascular Surgery.Will $50,000 per year result in any major scientific discoveries? Probably not, but it will send a very strong message to young and impressionable surgeons that the Society for Vascular Surgery supports and nurtures surgeon-scientists. If through this mechanism we stimulate vascular surgical research and provide young surgical investigators an opportunity to initiate careers as surgeon-scientists, then our mission will have been accomplished, because if we do not, who will?Industrial coalitionBefore she was named director of the NIH, Dr. Bernadine Healy wrote, \u201cIndustry has a vital role in promoting the brainpower of tomorrow. It is the clear-cut beneficiary of basic research, is a partner with M.D.-investigators in technology transfer, and has a vested interest in the quality of the next generation of scientific investigators.\u201dShe went on to add, \u201cThrough its philanthropic foundations, industry can creatively address some of the broader problems of science education.\u201dTo this end, the concept of establishing a coalition with our industrial colleagues to fund Lifeline Foundation initiatives received the unanimous endorsement of the Foundation board of directors. Industrial members of the coalition will be appropriately represented by the Industry. Advisory Council of the Foundation. It is expected that such representation will help refine Foundation objectives as well as provide funding and fund raising strategies so that a guaranteed budget for awards is continuously available. To this end, I, along with Dr. Robert Barnes, president of the ISCVS, and the Joint Council am recommending that future cocktail extravaganzas during the SVS/ISCVS meetings sponsored by industry. be discontinued. All exhibitors will be notified about this policy and urged to abandon plans for major social functions. The membership of both Societies will be notified of this policy by letters as well as by a policy statement in the printed programs of the annual meetings. We suggest that such entertainment funds be reallocated to support the Lifeline Foundation and the ISCVS Student Research Fellowships. Such a society-industrial coalition is long overdue. Recent concerns raised by the Council on Ethical and Judicial Affairs of the American Medical Association suggest that gifts to physicians from industry will come under increasing scrutiny.Consequently, documentation of reallocation of entertainment dollars to supplement research initiatives should prove justifiable and mutually rewarding.NIH relationshipsThe Society for Vascular Surgery under the early leadership of past president Strandness and in cooperation with the ISCVS, the NIH, and NHLBI has played an active role in promoting a forum to address Research Initiatives in Vascular Disease. This forum has provided visibility for vascular surgical research at the national level as well as in the research community and has proved immensely popular and successful. From the first forum in 1988 to the most recent one in February of 1991, attendance by surgeon-scientists has steadily increased. Of particular note is that the more than 200% increase in attendance by industrial representatives may represent a coalition developing between surgeon-scientists and industry to enhance our mutual objectives.That vascular surgery has been underrepresented at the national level is documented by lack of committee representation on the 1990 NHLBI Advisory Council where there is only one surgeon among 18 members, on the Cardiology Advisory committee where there are only two surgeons among 16, and on the Arteriosclerosis, Hypertension, and Lipid Metabolism Advisory Committee where there are no surgeons among 17 members. Unpublished data, circulated during the 1991 meeting of the American Surgical Association, confirm that surgeons now constitute a minority on study sections. For example, Surgery Study Section A is now the surgery-anesthesia-trauma study section on which surgeons are a minority. There are only seven surgeons, whereas there are five PhDs and five anesthesiologists. The surgery-bioengineering study section, formerly Surgery B, is composed of six surgeons, one dean, seven PhDs, and two chemical engineers. It is clear that surgical grant applications to these alleged surgery study sections are no longer truly peer reviewed. Therefore to enhance vascular surgical research funding and to provide a mechanism of acquiring representation on NIH advisory councils, advisory committees, and study sections, an SVS/ISCVS task force charged with providing liaison between the NIH and vascular surgery has been appointed by Dr. Robert Barnes and me. Additional task force charges are to develop strategies to increase federal research funding and to offer recommendations for developing curricula to educate surgeon-scientists. We are hopeful that such liaison will facilitate more vascular surgeon-scientist appointments to NHLBI committees. Such increased representation should prove mutually beneficial. Vascular surgeons who have made major contributions to vascular disease research over the past 50 years can thereby contribute more effectively in the future.ConclusionBy virtue of what we are: physician-surgeon-humanist, and what we do: innovative research and clinical application of new knowledge, we, as vascular surgeons, are inextricably bonded to society. We should not lose sight of the fact that this fundamental relationship between vascular surgery and society can only be perpetuated by dedicating ourselves to humanistic patient care and providing aLifelineto nurture young surgeon-scientists to the benefit of society. In spite of all the extraneous distracting socioeconomic issues, we must focus our efforts on not how they affect us but how they affect our patients. Ask not what society (our patients) can do for vascular surgery but what vascular surgery can do for society (our patients).",
  "1993": "On June 5, 1949, Dr. Walter Maddock, former Professor of Surgery and Chief of Surgery at Wesley Hospital, Northwestern University Medical School, presented his committee's proposed constitution and bylaws at the third annual meeting of the Society for Vascular Surgery (SVS) in the Dennis Hotel, Atlantic City, N.J. These were subsequently adopted by the membership and became Article I of the constitution. It reads as follows: \"The objects of this Society shall be 1) To promote the study and research in vascular disease, 2) To define more clearly the role of surgery in these diseases, 3) To pool the experience and knowledge of the membership in order to standardize methods of studying and managing of these diseases, 4) To standardize the nomenclature of these diseases, 5) To promote and encourage adequate teaching of these diseases to students, interns, and residents, 6) To encourage hospitals to develop special training for young surgeons interested in this field, and 7) To hold annual meetings.\"It has been nearly 50 years since these objects were adopted by the membership. I thought it would be of interest to review what we have accomplished, how much vascular surgery has changed, what the forces impelling these changes have been, and in what direction these changes are likely to lead us in the future. The opportunity for me to review the recommendation by Dr. Walter Maddock and his committee is of particular interest. He was mentor to Dr. John J. Bergan, who gave me the opportunity to launch my career in vascular surgery at Wesley Hospital and Northwestern University Medical School. Somehow we all share the same roots at Northwestern University Medical School, and all of us have had the distinguished privilege of serving this Society. From Dr. Walter Maddock, a founder of the SVS, who conceived these objectives, to Dr. John Bergan, thirty-eighth president, and then to myself, I found that the circumstance is unique and the achievements and changes of vascular surgery are truly remarkable. I titled this address as a second look because Dr. Jesse Thompson, 31st president, briefly reviewed these seven objects in his presidential address entitled \"The Founding Fathers.\"Object 1: To promote the study of and research in vascular diseasesEver since the founding of the SVS, promotion of research has been the first goal of many members. In recent years the meeting programs reflect the emergence of interest in research and study in vascular disease. Beginning with clinical observations to collective experience and finally to research in both clinical and basic science, there has been a significant increase in the emphasis on research. Significant efforts to promote research have also been initiated by several past presidents. These efforts include the annual research initiatives with the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, National Institutes of Health (NHLBI/NIH), the formation of the Ad Hoc Committee on Clinical Research, and the founding of the Lifeline Foundation as the research arm of the Society. Dr. Eugene Strandness is responsible for starting the research initiatives meeting, and an excellent working relationship has been established with NHLBI/NIH. Most important, this meeting provides an exchange between clinical investigators and basic scientists on specific subjects related to vascular disease. The formation of the Ad Hoc Committee on Clinical Research by Dr. William Fry affords the Society a means to devise strategies for clinical research in vascular surgery. It is hoped that the recent presentation by Dr. Patrick Clagett (Chairman, Ad Hoc Committee on Clinical Research) to the Cardiology Advisory Committee of NHLBI/NIH will result in implementation of some of the proposed projects.The need for an alternate source for support of research was first suggested by Dr. Allan Callow,and subsequent formation of the Lifeline Foundation by Dr. Calvin Ernstrepresents a major step by the SVS to promote research. Research support is now available for young independent investigators.Although there is significant progress in this object, what are the directions of vascular research for the younger generation of vascular surgeons? The study of vascular disease is no longer confined to William Harvey's original description of circulation, and an artery is not just a conduit but a complex organ with multiple functions. Endothelium and cellular structure of the arterial wall play an important role in homeostasis, inflammatory or immunologic reactions, and growth stimulus. These interactions are vital to the pathogenesis of disease of the arteries. The explosion of knowledge in this field has now led to the development of vascular biology. As stated by Victor Dzau: \"The future of the management of vascular disease will depend on the development of novel diagnostic and therapeutic strategies based on our growing knowledge of vascular biology.\" Recognizing the importance of this development, the NHLBI has recently initiated program projects in vascular biology and medicine with special emphasis on combined basic and clinical collaborative programs to facilitate technology transfer of the rapid advances in vascular biology into diagnostic, therapeutic, and preventive interventions for improving vascular health. Similarly, the American Heart Association (AHA) has established an intercouncil vascular biology working group to develop research goals in this field. AHA scientists have identified vascular biology and medicine as the prime avenues for further scientific research in the 1990s. Most research projects on vascular topics (57 of 160 grants) under funding by the NHLBI/NIH () are related to vascular biology. Similarly, 57 of 63 grants on vascular disease funded by AHA () are also on molecular biology (William Thesis, written communication, June 1992). <!--table not available-->Clearly, the future direction of vascular research is in the field of vascular biology. We need to train young surgeon-scientists in vascular biology. The task will not be simple. The complex nature of molecular technology will require close interaction and a synergistic relationship between basic scientists and surgeon-scientists. I would like to urge the Education Committee of the Program Directors and the Lifeline Foundation to give some thought to a structured curriculum in training and support of surgeon-scientists in vascular biology and surgery. Unless we act now, we will not be competitive with other disciplines in securing research funding for the younger generation of vascular surgeons.Not only is the direction of basic science research changing, but clinical research has now extended into the assessment of outcomes, and the analysis of effectiveness and appropriateness of care.The Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1989 created the Agency for Health Care Policy and Research (AHCPR) with a mission to enhance the quality of health care services.The AHCPR has primary responsibility for implementation of the Medical Treatment Effectiveness Program. The program is directed at gauging the effectiveness of medical or surgical interventions and developing guidelines for medical practice through the assessment of patient outcome. AHCPR supports large-scale studies that use a Patient Outcome Research Team (PORT) approach and less complex patient outcome research proposals with the regular research grant (RO-1) mechanism. These proposals, however, must contain multidisciplinary components. PORTs are multidisciplinary teams led by outstanding and acclaimed researchers in key academic institutions; both academic and practicing community-based physicians are included.In 1989, researchers from the Rand Corporation, the Academic Medical Center Consortium, and American Medical Association initiated the appropriateness project on carotid endarterectomyand aortic aneurysm. A 5-year PORT study of clinical strategies for stroke prevention is now in process. It is expected that claudication and femoral artery bypass will be subjects for future study. In addition, the Agency for Health Care Policy and Research also has established programs to study new technology.Beyond examining safety and efficacy as the basic element of technology assessment, the scope has now broadened into the measurement of effectiveness, considerations of quality of life, patient preferences, and especially the evaluation of costs and benefits. Directly or indirectly, outcome research will affect the practice of vascular surgery. We need to seek representation in health care research activities and to ensure that our knowledge of management of vascular disease is well represented in these government-sponsored studies. Younger members of this Society should seize this opportunity to participate in outcome research of vascular disease.Unlike disease of the artery, research in venous disease has received little attention. The formation of the American Venous Forum in 1989 by the Joint Council is a step in the right direction to promote research in venous disease. However, we should not fragment the study of the vascular system into different surgical societies. Leaders of the venous forum should work closely with this Society to promote research in this much-neglected area.Object 2: To define more clearly the role of surgery in these diseasesSince the introduction of direct arterial surgery in the late 1950s, surgical treatment for arterial occlusive disease has evolved from endarterectomy to graft replacement. An indirect procedure such as lumbar sympathectomy is now seldom used in patients with limb ischemia. The extension of femoral bypass graft from popliteal artery to more distal tibial arteries has clearly established this procedure as a standard technique in limb salvage, especially in diabetic patients. For aortic aneurysm the size and indication for surgical intervention are now better defined. No surgical procedure has been more vigorously critiqued than carotid endarterectomy. This procedure, introduced 40 years ago, has withstood the close scrutiny of neurologist colleagues, and recent clinical trials have confirmed the efficacy of carotid endarterectomy in preventing stroke in patients with high-grade carotid artery stenosis.The compelling change in the role of surgery in the treatment of vascular disease is technology innovation, as stated clearly by Dr. Francis D. Moore,who said, \"Advances in surgery have resided largely in the growth of an effective technology.\" The development of percutaneous transluminal dilation with a balloon catheter has indeed proved to be an effective technology. The durability of balloon dilation for short segmental stenosis of the iliac artery has largely eliminated the need for endarterectomy or bypass in these patients. Similarly, the development of percutaneous placement of a vena cava filter has gradually replaced the operative approach for vena cava interruption to prevent fatal pulmonary embolism. Not only technology innovation, but also refinement of pharmacologic agents such as newer thrombolytic drugs offers alternate techniques to reopen occluded graft, acute thrombosed artery, or to lysis cardiac emboli.Evolution of technology is inevitable, and it is expected that newer therapeutic approaches to vascular disease will continue to emerge. To look back over the past 4 decades, treatment of vascular disease has progressed from an anatomic approach in the early stages of vascular surgery to an interest in hemodynamics in the 1970s and 1980s. In the 1990s breakthroughs in the field of cellular and molecular biology will likely provide a biologic approach to vascular problems. Restenosis is common, and use of a molecular approach to understand the mechanism will provide newer therapeutic options. Gene transfer is now within the reach of clinical investigators, and there is no reason not to expect that bypass graft patency may be extended by this technique. Although bypass graft is the mainstay of our practice, the introduction of endovascular grafting technique will change our thinking and practice in the treatment of aortic aneurysm or arterial occlusion. Vascular surgeons need to participate in this field and also to evaluate these new technologies objectively and critically. I fully recognize the impact that endovascular graft may have on our surgical practice, and I have therefore asked the Joint Council to establish a Committee for the Study of Endovascular Graft (Chairman: Brian Thiele; members: Rutherford, Green, Goldstone, Veith, Johnston, Abbott, Hollier, Dean, Ring; consultants: Moore, Yao, Dake, and Parodi). The committee's charge is to 1) develop guidelines for experimental studies, 2) institute multicenter trials in humans, 3) establish a national registry to monitor the long-term results of endovascular graft, 4) facilitate technology transfer to practicing surgeons, 5) address reimbursement issues, and finally and most important, 6) ensure safety of the procedure for patients. Preliminary communications with Food and Drug Administration and NIH to implement these activities have been established. It is interesting to note that when prosthetic graft was first introduced in 1956, the SVS also established a Committee for the Study of Vascular Prostheses. (Chairman: Robert Linton; members: Shumacker, Julian, Detering, Edwards, and Creech).Object 3: To pool the experience and knowledge of the membership, in order to standardize methods of studying and managing these diseasesThere are several ways to pool the knowledge of the members, and these include scientific presentations at the annual meeting, postgraduate courses, multicenter trials, consensus conferences, a national registry, and publication of a scientific journal. We have succeeded quite well in scientific presentations at annual meetings and in postgraduate courses. However, we pay very little attention to consensus conferences, a national registry, and multicenter trials. A consensus conference offers an excellent exchange among specialists of different disciplines and paves the way for developing guidelines in clinical practice. As for multicenter trials, the Society has enough resources to conduct a trial for any specific vascular topic. Both a consensus conference and a multicenter trial fulfill Object 3 to standardize the methods of managing vascular disease. Although funding of Young Investigators is the mission of the Lifeline Foundation, the foundation also needs to consider support of activities such as a multicenter trial, a national vascular registry, and a consensus conference.The best way to pool knowledge, perhaps, is through communication with a journal dedicated to the science and art of vascular surgery. Acting on the recommendation by Dr. Michael DeBakey for a new journal, the Joint Council under the leadership of Dr. John Ochsner accepted a proposal from C. V. Mosby Company to publish the JOURNAL OFVASCULARSURGERYfor both the SVS and the North American Chapter of the International Society for Cardiovascular Surgery (ISCVS-NA). The birth of the JOURNAL OFVASCULARSURGERYhas provided members with an official organ to exchange scientific information. The JOURNALmade its first appearance in January 1984 with Dr. Michael DeBakey as chief editor, and D. Emerick Szilagyi and Jesse Thompson as senior editors. The journal was an instant success and has since assumed an undisputed role as the leading surgical journal in vascular surgery. At present, under the editorship of Drs. James Stanley and Calvin Ernst, the Journal has a circulation of 8611 copies and has been consistently ranked as the top surgical journal in the Citation Index.To standardize methods of managing vascular disease, the SVS has taken an initial step by developing reporting standards on vascular disease. Under the leadership of Robert Rutherford, many members of the Society have participated in the Ad Hoc Committee on Reporting Standards of the Joint Societies to develop reporting standards for lower extremity ischemia, venous disease, cerebrovascular disease, arterial aneurysms, noninvasive cerebrovascular testing, and arterial prostheses.These published reports establish the guidelines for reporting results of treatment in these disease categories. Now that the standards for reporting have been established, the Society is developing practice guidelines to standardize management of these diseases. So far, practice guidelines on carotid endarterectomy and aortic aneurysms have been published.Object 4: To standardize the nomenclature of these diseasesThis object represents the foresight of the founding fathers regarding the importance of precise terminology for a disease category or a surgical procedure. We are all aware of the inadequacy of the Hsiao studyon coding of vascular procedures. Even in the Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) code book, many procedures are improperly coded. Improper coding of vascular procedures will cause inequitable payment in the current resource-based relative value scale payment formula. Similarly, improper classification of diagnosis-related groups has caused inadequate reimbursement from Medicare for patients having complex limb salvage procedures.Standardization of nomenclature of vascular disease must begin with both CPT codes and International Classification of Diseases (ICD) codes. These two systems of coding directly affect reimbursement. The CPT codes were introduced in 1966, and this system of terminology is now the most widely accepted nomenclature for the reporting of physician procedures and services under government and private health insurance programs. CPT codes are under the auspices of the American Medical Association (AMA), with an editorial panel and an advisory committee to formulate the codes. However, the CPT codes have many errors and do not necessarily represent current vascular surgical procedures. The ICD codes, first developed by the World Health Organization to track mortality and morbidity rates, have evolved to a long list of classification of diseases. In 1977 the United States National Center for Health Statistics adapted this classification, and the ICD system now provides a way to classify morbidity data for indexing of medical records, medical case reviews, and ambulatory and other medical care programs, and for basic health statistics. The passage of the Medicare Catastrophic Coverage Act in 1988 by Congress mandated the use of ICD codes on each \"Part-B\" claim submitted by physicians. The Health Care Financing Administration has now provided specific guidelines to aid in standardizing coding practice. To achieve Object 4, we need to seek better representation and participation in the process of CPT coding. Unfortunately the process for CPT coding is caught in the political arena of different medical organizations. The Government Relations Committee, under the direction of Frank Veith, Dennis Baker, and Norman Hertzer, is now in the process of resolving the current inadequacy of the CPT and ICD-9 coding systems. At present, the SVS is working with the AMA Editorial Panel to overhaul the 200-plus CPT codes in vascular surgery and also vascular noninvasive diagnostic tests.Object 5: To promote and encourage adequate teaching of these diseases to students, interns, and residentsContrary to fears of the fragmentation of general surgery, the vascular surgery fellowship program has resulted in better teaching of vascular disease to residents and interns in general surgery.Teaching vascular disease is now a part of the medical school curriculum for junior medical students. Also, in many medical schools, an elective course for senior student rotation is available to encourage medical students to enter this field. Because many vascular fellowship programs involve time in a research laboratory, certification has been a substantial stimulus to scholarly activity in many surgical departments. To further promote teaching, we need to provide residents in general vascular surgery with a better structured curriculum in both clinical and basic science. At the same time we also need to determine how much a general surgical resident should know about diagnosis and management of vascular disease. Newer teaching techniques, such as the use of the computer, should also be our objective in developing better teaching to students, residents, and fellows. The explosion of knowledge and technology in the field of cellular and molecular biology calls for integration of teaching in a biologic approach to vascular disease for young investigators. I would like to urge the Education Committee of the Program Directors to improve our attainment of this objective by establishing a more structured curriculum for training of clinical and surgeon-scientist vascular surgeons.Object 6: To encourage hospitals to develop special training for young surgeons interested in this fieldThis object has been achieved, but not without a struggle. The entire process took the SVS/ISCVS-NA 10 years to establish an approved training program in vascular surgery. In the early 1970s, several members of this Society, in particular E. J. Wylie, thirty-third president, were dissatisfied with the quality of peripheral vascular surgery being performed in this country and proposed methods to improve the training of vascular surgeons.In 1971 the Vascular Surgery Resources Subcommittee, headed by Dr. James DeWeese, recommended a training program to improve surgical skills for vascular surgeons.In the same year, a resolution was made by SVS/ISCVS-NA and approved by the members to proceed with plans for the development of a certificate of special competence in vascular surgery. Preliminary discussion with the American Board of Surgery was then made by Drs. Wiley Barker and Jesse Thompson.On June 13, 1973, the American Board of Surgery voted approval in principle of the program for a subcertificate in vascular surgery. From there on, there has been a long process of negotiation with various governing agencies, including the American College of Surgeons, the Council on Medical Education of the AMA, the American Board of Surgery, the American Board of Thoracic Surgery, and the Resident Review Committee (RRC). Many general surgeons were greatly concerned about fragmentation of general surgery. The American Surgical Association issued a strong statement from its committee on the need to preserve general surgery.Resistance to change is natural. Fortunately, through the perserverance and leadership of many past presidents and members, Object 6, \"to develop special training for young surgeons interested in this field\" has finally been achieved. Contributors to this endeavor include Drs. William Blaisdell, John Foster, Sterling Edwards, Hasan Najafi, Keith Reemstsma, William Fry, Emerick Szilagyi, Edward Garrett, and John Mannick.In June 1979 the Joint Council of SVS/ISCVS-NA approved implementation of evaluation and endorsement of vascular training programs. In 1983, 54 training programs were approved by the Program Evaluation and Endorsement Committee.Finally, the American Board of Surgery with the approval of the American Board of Medical Specialties offered certification of special qualifications in general vascular surgery through examination in November 1983. At the same time the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education and the RRC approved Special Requirements for Accreditation of Training Programs in General Vascular Surgery. At present, there are 68 accredited programs offering 85 positions for specialized training in vascular surgery. In the United States, 1250 surgeons have received a vascular certificate (887 in special qualifications and 363 in added qualifications) (Ward Griffin, written communication, March 1993).Although it is gratifying to witness the establishment of this specialty and to achieve the goal of the founding fathers, some areas need improvement. Many programs are now offering an additional year for basic science research. We need to develop a better curriculum in basic science teaching, especially in the field of vascular biology. Furthermore, we need to have a better dialogue with the American Board of Surgery and the RRC to further define teaching for general surgery residents in the management of vascular disease. The issue of freestanding vascular training programs has not been resolved. Are we to continue to train two classes of vascular surgeon?It is expected that the newly formed Program Directors' Committee, chaired by Drs. William Baker and John Porter, will address these issues.Object 7: To hold annual meetingsThis is, perhaps, the best accomplished object of the Society. Since 1946, annual meetings have been held in different cities. The first meeting was held in Atlantic City with nine presentations. Presentations were gradually increased to more than 20 presentations. In the first decade (1947 to 1956) presentations on direct surgery on arteries, such as excision of thoracic aortic aneurysm by thromboendarterectomy, aortic aneurysm surgery, and the use of homograft or vein graft, were the highlights of the program. In the next decade (1957 to 1966), heart surgery and reconstructive arterial surgery, especially the use of prosthetic graft, dominated the presentations. From 1967 to 1976, physiologic measurements, especially noninvasive tests, are common topics at annual meetings. From 1977 to the present, presentations on topics in basic science have steadily increased, especially in the past 3 years. Interest in cardiac subjects began to fade in the late 70s, and presentation on cardiac subjects made the last appearance in 1981. From 1981 on, the scientific program has been confined to vascular disease and surgery exclusively. This change in the pattern of scientific presentations reflects the change in the composition of membership of the Society and to a certain extent the emergence of vascular surgery as an established subspecialty.In addition to a change in content of the presentations, the format of the meeting has also changed significantly. The joint meeting with ISCVS-NA began in 1970. In 1975 breakfast sessions were introduced to provide discussion on a more focused topic. Beginning in 1989 a research forum, designed to give young investigators an opportunity to present their work, was added to the program.In recognition of the socioeconomic problems that the Society may face in the future, Stanley Crawford, thirty-ninth president of the Society, initiated a Forum on Critical Issues in 1989. Since then, many important social, economic, and educational issues have been discussed. The Critical Issues Forum has now been renamed as the E. Stanley Crawford Critical Issues Forum by the Joint Council in recognition of his vision in bringing matters of vital interest to the attention of members of the Society.Overall, Object 7 has been a great success. The results of a recent survey by Gerald Goldstone of members of ISCVS-NA have confirmed the satisfactory grading of the format of the meeting. Attendance from SVS members has increased from 79 in 1960 to 224 in 1990.Future challengesChange is always with us, and the practice of vascular surgery is now strikingly different from that of 1946. Technology innovation has led to a change in surgical practice and research priorities. Government intervention or control is now a fact of life in our daily practice. Although we have achieved most of the objects set forth by the founding fathers, we have to adjust to these changes and to chart a new course for the future. Two areas of particular concern are the emergence of vascular medicine and national health care reform and government control.Vascular medicineThe rapid development of vascular biology and interventional technology has prompted cardiologists to engage in a movement to develop a vascular medicine program.In 1988 the strategic planning committee of the American College of Cardiology formed a vascular disease committee to develop recommendations on issues of training and practice in vascular medicine. At the same time, the American Heart Association's Science Advisory Committee developed guidelines for an interdisciplinary vascular center in hospitals. In 1991, NHLBI/NIH initiated the Academic Award in Systemic and Pulmonary Vascular Disease to foster integration of a clinical, education, and research program in vascular disease. Five academic awards have been granted, and it is expected that a total of 20 awards will be funded in the next 5 years (David Robinson, personal communication). The main objective of the Academic Award is to apply a multidisciplinary approach to patient care, educational activities, and research relevant to disease of the vascular system.How do we cope with this new movement in vascular medicine? First, we need to recognize that the vascular system and its diseases should be viewed as a single system, rather than a set of different vascular beds. Atherosclerotic changes of an artery, whether they affect the coronary or femoral artery, share a common etiologic pathway. Second, we need to realize that treatment of vascular disease is no longer by an operative procedure alone. Technology innovation has changed the pattern of management. Third, although vascular surgeons have recognized risk factors, we seldom participate in the preventive aspect of this disease, and prevention is the key to progress.As the only specialty with the best knowledge of vascular disease, we need to take a leadership role in the development of vascular medicine. Unlike Europe, where standard training programs for vascular medicine are common in France and Switzerland, internists with a special interest in vascular medicine are uncommon in the United States.Training of specialists in vascular medicine cannot be done by cardiology alone. A team approach bringing existing specialties, including vascular surgeons, vascular interventional radiologists, hematologists, cardiologists, and preventive cardiologists to give \"total care\" to patients with vascular disease will ultimately result in better care for these patients. Vascular surgeons need to be captain of this team, and I urge members of this Society to apply for this award and to develop a vascular center in their own hospital. A vascular center will serve the purpose of these movements and at the same time will allow us to maintain the leadership in delivering the best care to these patients.National health care reform and government controlI do not believe I need to emphasize the importance of and the need for reform in the national health care system in this country. When these seven objects were adopted by the Society, government intrusion or control was nonexistent. The climate of practice has changed greatly, especially in the past decade. From diagnosis-related groups, resource-based relative value scales, and the new Clinton plan on health care reform, there will be an ongoing process of government control, not only in practice but also in education in vascular surgery. To protect the objectives of this Society, we must seek to develop a better dialogue and to maintain a strong representation of vascular surgery with various government agencies. For the past several years, under the leadership of Norman Hertzer, the Society has established a Government Relations Committee to address reimbursement issues with the Health Care Financing Administration. No one can do better than your incoming president Norman Hertzer, and I am confident he will lead us through this challenging time.When our founders established the SVS, they knew that for the Society to endure, it would have to change. The younger generation of vascular surgeons must rise to meet the challenge of change in our practice. Not change for change's sake, but change to give better care to our patients. As Dr. Edward Churchill said, \"Surgery need not fear change if civilization itself survives.\"",
  "1994": "I always wanted to be a surgeon. Surgeons were able to help people in a uniquely direct way, and the surgeons I most admired were willing to sacrifice something of themselves to do it. Good surgeons could look anyone squarely in the eye because they had invested their lives in a career that made a difference. They acted decisively when the best interests of their patients hung in the balance. They elevated their profession. I wanted to be one of them, and so did you.These are the reasons most of us became surgeons in the first place. The time again has come to embrace them because nearly every surgeon now must also contend with the incidental uncertainties imposed by a sputtering economy, runaway healthcare expenses, a contentious bureaucracy, and a concerned public. Those who say they want to make things better through reform often mean that they only want to make them cheaper. Better, it seems to me, still is up to us. If we can distance ourselves for a moment from the daily confusion regarding healthcare and how to finance it, the present debate about quality and cost offers an unmistakable opportunity for us to make vascular surgery better than it ever has been. We just have to get back to those fundamentals. What do we really stand for as surgeons? I think we stand forresults.INDICATIONS AND GUIDELINESIn 1977 Easton and Shermanreported their bellwether data indicating that all was not well with carotid endarterectomy. In a series of 229 operations performed during the previous 6 years at two 600-bed community hospitals in Springfield, Illinois, they found that the combined stroke and mortality rate was an astonishing 21% (stroke rate, 14%; mortality rate, 6.6%). In 1984 Moore et al.incidentally reviewed the next 510 consecutive carotid endarterectomies performed at the same two hospitals and showed that stroke and mortality rates had improved dramatically to 5.4% and 1.6%, respectively. Because even more surgeons had continued to perform a low volume of only three to four procedures annually during the second period of study, what can explain the enhanced safety of carotid endarterectomy in southern Illinois? Perhaps it is the fact that the incidence of prior stroke as a surgical indication had declined from 43% to 19%, a feature suggesting that too many operations had been done in the setting of acute or profound strokes in comparison to contemporary standards in the 1970s. What the Springfield experience demonstrated most clearly, however, is that poor surgical results must first be discovered before they can be corrected.More than a decade later the RAND Corporation employed a multidisciplinary panel to reach a consensus concerning appropriate indications for carotid endarterectomy and then conducted a survey among 1302 Medicare patients in three geographic areas, which indicated that only about one third of carotid artery operations were performed for acceptable reasons.These findings were widely reported in the lay press and, predictably, undermined at least some public confidence regarding surgical advice. In conjunction with RAND, the American College of Surgeons subsequently convened a specialty panel of vascular and neurologic surgeons to develop its own appropriateness ratings for carotid endarterectomy, which also were applied to the same population of Medicare patients.Alarmingly, nearly 20% of these operations still were considered to have been inappropriate. Furthermore, the combined stroke and mortality rate for these 1302 carotid endarterectomies was 9.8%. Interest in practice guidelines has exploded during the past 10 years, and vascular surgery is well represented among them.Nevertheless, practice guidelines alone are no substitute for quality control because, in the presence of excessive complication rates, poor results can still occur despite appropriate surgical indications.HOSPITAL STANDARDSMost people probably assume that hospitals are required to document their results, especially with respect to major surgery. With the exception of organ transplantation and certain cancer registries, however, this generally is not the case. Precious few hospitals could muster an accurate response even to relatively simple questions concerning their operative mortality and serious complication rates for common vascular surgical procedures. This tradition of benign neglect is neither good science nor good business, and it cannot endure because hospitals, like banks, are no longer above suspicion. Patients want to know what they are getting into, and payors have begun to dig for answers themselves.The Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA) attempted to restrict its initial distribution of Medicare hospital mortality rates to Peer Review Organizations (PROs) in 1986, but these crude data soon were released to the public in response to requests filed under the Freedom of Information Act. The result was chaos, as \"outlier\" hospitals scrambled for damage control within their marketing areas. Large hospitals defended their mortality rates on the basis of a difficult case mix, whereas small hospitals claimed their rates were skewed by low volume and sample size. By 1987 HCFA had amended its format in a number of ways to satisfy skepticism among hospitals, and most of them eventually fell within acceptable ranges of inpatient mortality rates.HCFA ultimately discontinued its annual disclosures in 1992, but, until then, much of the criticism leveled at Medicare mortality profiles had focused on the absence of a universal model for severity of illness.No one should dismiss the importance of severity indexing, but it also must be placed into perspective before it merely becomes an excuse not to do anything. First, many surgical procedures (carotid endarterectomy, for instance) lend themselves to adequate severity indexing strictly according to their indications. Second, severity of illness seems much more difficult to define in the context of national \"batch\" statistics than it is at the local level where hospital charts are available for clarification. Finally, if we wait until severity indexing is perfected, we may never attain outcome assessment in our lifetimes. In 1991 there were 6634 hospitals in the United States, 82% of which had fewer than 300 beds (69%, < 200 beds) and accounted for fully half of the 33.6 million patient admissions that year. More than 22 million surgical operations were performed in all short-term nonfederal hospitals, nearly 4 million of which were done in rural community hospitals.In aggregate, this represents a whole lot of results not to have anywhere on the screen.Investigators from the RAND Corporation have concluded from Medicare data that overall mortality rates are excessive in about 12% of United States hospitals and that large, urban, or teaching centers are likely to have the best results.Nevertheless, several other studies have consistently demonstrated that the annual volume of specific surgical procedures, such as aortic reconstruction, is inversely related to their mortality rates (high volume/low risk, low volume/high risk).The notion that volume is a better predictor of hospital performance than either its size or location makes intuitive sense, and carotid endarterectomy again is a good example. In their review of 2089 carotid artery operations performed within the Medicare population at 139 New England hospitals in 1984 and 1985, Fisher et al.found that mortality and confirmed stroke morbidity rates correlated as closely with hospital volume as with patient age (). It is interesting to note that hospitals with an exceedingly low volume of this operation (\u2264 5 in 15 months) comprised 36% of the New England survey. This is consistent with the fact that fewer than 10 carotid endarterectomies were performed annually at 45% of all hospitals in which Medicare beneficiaries received this procedure from 1985 through 1989.There is reason to believe that the outcome of carotid endarterectomy is a good proxy for other results in vascular surgery. Chassin et al.collected 1984 data for the 30 most common diagnosis-related groups for which charges were submitted from nearly 5 million admissions to more than 5000 hospitals. Of 48 homogeneous medical and surgical conditions that were developed from a statistical model, only four had adjusted mortality rates that clearly could be correlated from one condition to another; three (carotid endarterectomy, aortic reconstruction, lower extremity revascularization) involved vascular surgery, and the fourth (total hip replacement) involved orthopedic surgery. In other words if a hospital did well, or poorly, with one of these operations, then it tended to do equally well, or poorly, with the rest of them.SURGEON STANDARDSShould hospital standards be established concerning the minimum acceptable volume of vascular surgical procedures? Sloan et al.cautioned against this approach because they calculated that the surgical volume at which procedure-specific mortality rates reached their lowest levels far exceeded the actual volume achievable at most hospitals. In my opinion the critical issue really is whether a hospital has a solid nucleus of surgeons who are capable of good vascular surgery because they are experienced, well trained, or both. Luft et al.made the following perceptive observation during their original work regarding the relationship between hospital volume and mortality rates over 15 years ago:We should emphasize that operations are performed and patients are cared for not by hospitals but by surgeons, anesthesiologists, operating-room teams and nursing staffs. The poor outcomes in a specific hospital may be the result of the good outcomes of one well qualified surgeon being swamped by the poor outcomes of several \"occasional\" surgeons.This principle is convincingly illustrated by Gibbs and Guzzettain their report of an audit of the combined stroke and mortality rates associated with carotid endarterectomy at three community hospitals in San Diego ().The incidence of serious complications ranged from 4.8% to 7.8% at these hospitals, but the authors' composite event rate (1.7%) was significantly better than the comparable figure (11%,p< 0.001) for all other surgeons at the same hospitals. There is absolutely no question that vascular surgery can be performed in community practice with results that are every bit as good as those at referral centers.This has been the most important objective of additional postgraduate training in vascular surgery, and those of us who maintain fellowship programs are proud of it. We must never fail to recognize, however, that outcomes can be very inconsistent among thousands of surgeons, and that there is compelling evidence that procedure-specific volume is an important element of this equation. These considerations become even more critical in the context that surgeons can be expected to perform fewer operations, both individually and collectively, in the future.In an excellent summary of the uncertain relationship between general surgery and its specialty components, Wheelerhas estimated that vascular surgery comprises only 2.8% of the operative experience of practicing general surgeons. Yet as recently as the late 1980s, lower extremity revascularization, aortic aneurysm resection, and carotid endarterectomy were among the 20 most common procedures in general surgery. Does the low-volume vascular surgery implied by these numbers influence results?Lower extremity revascularizationAccording to data collected by the Cleveland Vascular Society in 1984, there was a significant, inverse relationship between the early amputation rate after infrainguinal bypass and the annual experience with these procedures on the part of the surgeons participating in our registry.Amputations were necessary for 9.3% of patients whose surgeons performed fewer than 10 infrainguinal bypasses each year, compared with a figure of 2.8% (p< 0.001) among surgeons who did more than 25, despite the fact that the essential risk factors (age, diabetes, focal gangrene, previous operations) were similar for both groups. Since then we have updated the overall mortality and amputation rates for more than 10,000 patients who underwent lower extremity revascularization in northeastern Ohio from 1975 through 1990 ().Some of these results are worse than those reported in the literature even though most of our registry participants dedicate at least a substantial fraction of their practices to vascular surgery. To my knowledge there are no other data with which to compare them because outcome standards for lower extremity revascularization in other communities are virtually unknown.This is a serious problem that perhaps only surgeons at large referral centers can fully appreciate. Hardly a week goes by that a patient or two does not arrive in our department at the request of their families after unsuccessful bypass attempts elsewhere. They usually have been told that amputations are necessary because \"nothing else can be done,\" but after a better angiogram is obtained to locate an outflow target or a bit of innovation in the construction of an autogenous graft, limb salvage often is feasible. According to the National Center for Health Statistics, approximately 100,000 patients are discharged from United States hospitals after lower extremity revascularization each year.Quite frankly I wonder how many of them lose their legs unnecessarily.Aortic aneurysm resectionSteady improvement in the safety of elective infrarenal aortic aneurysm resection long has been considered an indication of progress in vascular surgery, but poor results seldom are published. A number of statewide surveys have either proved or strongly suggested that the risk of elective aneurysm repair is seriously influenced by the annual case volume of the responsible surgeons (). One of the first of these was conducted in the 1970s by Pilcher et al.in Vermont, where the mortality rate for surgeons who rarely performed aneurysm resection was twice the rate for those who did even a few. A subsequent study revealed similar results in Kentucky with use of the modest criterion of only five procedures a year to designate high volume.Most recently Hannan et al.reviewed 3570 elective resections from the state of New York and again found a linear, inverse relationship between case volume and mortality rates for surgeons who annually performed two or fewer operations (11% mortality), 3 to 9 operations (7.3% mortality), or 10 or more operations (5.6% mortality). Identical trends also have been demonstrated in Europe, by the way, and they may apply to ruptured as well as to intact aneurysms.Small state or large, rural or urban, the information available from Vermont, Kentucky, and New York suggest that about 30% of the elective aneurysm resections in the U.S. are performed by surgeons whose annual experience is limited to one or two procedures with two to three times the mortality rate of surgeons who do only a few more operations each year. These data underscore the principal liability of inadequate outcome assessment at the local level. The problem is collective; to appreciate it, simply multiply it by several thousand hospitals.Carotid endarterectomyErnst et al.demonstrated in their 1987 manpower survey that carotid endarterectomy was at that time the most common peripheral vascular procedure performed in the U.S., and they estimated that about half of these operations were done by \"nonvascular\" neurologic, cardiothoracic, or general surgeons. Whatever their specialty fields, a surprising number of surgeons who perform carotid endarterectomy do so in exceedingly low volume. For example, 24% of surgeons in the RAND appropriateness survey and 43% of those in a statewide audit in Connecticut were responsible for only a single carotid artery procedure annually.Considering what we already know about the volume/outcome relationship in a number of other areas, the implications of these observations are entirely predictable. Retrospective studies in Connecticut and in Kentucky have confirmed statistically that volume is inversely related to outcome as measured by both mortality and stroke rates ().There is another study that should be brought to the attention of vascular surgeons, not just because it contains important information and appeared in a publication with which they may be unfamiliar, but also because it was conducted by an innovative PRO and may influence public policy in the future. In their review of the Medicare database in Pennsylvania (1989 to 1992), Segal et al.found that only 52 (8%) of the 652 surgeons who performed carotid endarterectomies in that large state did more than 30 operations during a 26-month period, 417 (64%) fewer than five, and 239 (37%) only one. Mortality rates assumed their familiar inverse relationship to surgeon volume, and, of additional interest to payors, so did hospital charges ().The latter is not surprising because stroke rates are substantially higher than mortality rates for carotid artery procedures, and strokes are expensive complications. These findings lend additional support to earlier recommendations that the results of carotid endarterectomy should be audited on a prospective basis.HOSPITAL CREDENTIALINGBefore I go any further, let me mention that I do not favor the establishment of minimum volume standards for surgeons. However compelling they may be, national or even statewide trends concerning case volume and outcome do not necessarily reflect conditions in each and every setting. A requirement that surgeons must perform a specific number of certain procedures to retain their privileges in those areas might well prejudice their indications for surgical treatment. There already are examples in the literature (and undoubtedly many others that have gone unpublished) of situations in which an audit has determined that the busiest surgeon in a community has had the worst results.Furthermore, low volume probably is a common denominator for young surgeons who recently have completed their training, as well as for veteran surgeons who are considering retirement, yet both are quite capable of excellent outcomes. Finally, minimum volume standards would be confusing to referring physicians and patients alike, and they generally sound bureaucratic and unworkable to me. From my perspective qualified surgeons who want to perform one aortic aneurysm resection or two carotid endarterectomies a year should be permitted to do so,but they should be accountable for their results.In the final analysis all of our results speak for themselves, and we desperately need a system that recognizes it.Such a system was suggested 5 years ago by a subcommittee appointed by the Joint Council of the Society for Vascular Surgery (SVS) and the North American Chapter of the International Society for Cardiovascular Surgery (ISCVS-NA). In an attempt to bring some objectivity to the entire credentialing process, Moore et al.recommended the use of prospective outcome assessment as a means for hospitals to grant and renew privileges in vascular surgery with respect to candidates who meet basic criteria regarding training or experience. According to this plan all surgeons receiving privileges should participate in continuous audits of mortality and procedure-specific complication rates for four index operations (carotid endarterectomy, elective infrarenal aortic aneurysm resection, aortofemoral reconstruction, and infrainguinal bypass). Surgeons who have not performed a minimum of 75 procedures in any of these areas during the previous 3-year audit cycle would be assigned a sufficient number of complication-free proxy cases to adjust the impact of a rare poor result. In response to this article a number of hospital credentialing committees have expressed their gratitude that some legitimate guidelines finally were available for them to go about their difficult business.And for good reason. The courts in many states have reached decisions that directly acknowledge the risk of hospitals for the performance of their professional staffs. In Ohio, however, allowance has been made for requisite care in the appointment of staff members and their ongoing peer review:In regard to staff privileges, a hospital has a direct duty to grant and to continue such privileges only to competent physicians. (A plaintiff) must demonstrate that but for the lack of care in the selection or the retention of the physician, the physician would not have been granted staff privileges, and the plaintiff would not have been injured. (Albain v Flower Hospital, 50 3d 251 [Ohio St 1990]).This implies that a hospital is not vicariously liable for physician malpractice, provided requisite care has been used during the credentialing process. The problem is that, with few exceptions, there is no \"community standard\" for surgeon performance in this country and there never has been. On a few occasions I have been invited to arbitrate decisions concerning the suspension of vascular privileges from individual surgeons at community hospitals. These proceedings typically represented smoldering local disputes that had turned into such legal stalemates that both parties and their counsel agreed to have an impartial referee review the charts of selected patients whose treatment allegedly had been substandard. Because incomplete information can be misleading, I asked what the overall results were for the operations in question, not only those done by Dr. X, but also by the other surgeons who performed them at the same hospital. The inevitable response was, \"Whadhesay?\" How much better it would be for the hospital if data were available to prove that the mortality, stroke, or amputation rates for Dr. X were significantly (and I meansignificantly) worse than those of his or her peers; how much better it would be for Dr. X if data were available to prove that they were not.Outcome surveillanceBeyond the anguish they bring to the patients and surgeons who sustain them, serious complications are costly both to hospitals and to payors. Unless we take the matter of outcome surveillance into our own hands, others surely will take it into theirs. The Pennsylvania Health Care Cost Containment Councilalready has published a consumer guide to coronary artery bypass, which contains hospital- and surgeon-specific mortality data, and it will be surprising if the spadework done for the PRO in that state by Segal et al.does not lead to a similar publication concerning carotid endarterectomy. Furthermore, the Physician Payment Review Commissionhas recommended in its 1994 annual report to Congress that:The quality of care system under health system reform should include quality performance reports, a quality improvement system, and external quality assurance programs. . . Review by an external organization should include an examination of the internal quality assurance program, specified quality measures, (and) credentialing of providers.Finally, the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations (JCAHO) has initiated a project regarding outcome measurement, which ultimately will become part of the accreditation process for American hospitals (William F. Jessee, MD, written communication, March 1994). Both plans now under review by the Physician Payment Review Committee and the JCAHO seem to be unnecessarily complex and almost certainly have been developed without the advice of a single vascular surgeon.Policymakers must be persuaded that specialty societies such as ours are best prepared to establish the specific criteria for outcome assessment throughout the surgical disciplines. In an attempt to do so, the Joint Council of the SVS/ISCVS-NA authorized me nearly a year ago to present the following proposals to HCFA, the JCAHO, or key congressional participants in healthcare reform:\u2022Mortality and major complication rates for representative surgical procedures should be prospectively audited at every hospital;\u2022Specialty societies should select three index procedures and their related complications to be included in these audits;\u2022The feasibility of prospective audits should be tested with a pilot study in vascular surgery.Few would disagree that carotid endarterectomy, standard aortic aneurysm resection, and infrainguinal revascularization presently are the three signature operations in vascular surgery (). Their preoperative indications generally have distinct implications with respect to postoperative outcome in the vast majority of patients, and their serious complications (death, stroke, or amputation) are just as well defined. Additional consideration clearly needs to be given to the influence of reoperations on outcome, especially when they are required under urgent circumstances in patients who have been transferred from one hospital to another. Does this system represent a perfect stratification of risk? Perhaps not, but a couple of things must be kept in mind. First, these same criteria have been used to report results in countless case series throughout the literature, so they appear to be perfectly adequate for the purpose of determining true outliers. Second, they comprise a legitimate framework for vascular surgeons to begin their negotiations with those who otherwise may be compelled to impose their own outcome criteria on ussimply because we have failed to take any action ourselves.This already has happened for coronary artery bypass in New York, and, judging from the results, it is unlikely to stop there. In 1989 the state Department of Health began to collect, analyze, and disseminate information regarding bypass mortality and complication rates for each of 30 hospitals, and eventually for individual surgeons as well. Surgeon-specific data originally were not intended for the public record, but because hardly anything escapes the Freedom of Information Act these days, the courts eventually ordered their disclosure in 1992. Surgeons objected to this for a number of reasons, including their concern that certain patients at high risk might no longer be considered to be acceptable candidates for elective surgical treatment. Nevertheless, from 1989 to 1992 the annual number of coronary artery bypass procedures in New York grew from 12,269 to 16,028 and their overall mortality rate declined from 3.5% to 2.8%. Furthermore, the risk-adjusted mortality rate fell from 4.2% to 2.4%, despite the fact that the expected mortality rate (a measure for severity of illness) simultaneously increased from 2.6% to 3.5%.Whatever you feel about public disclosure of potentially sensitive information in the United States during the 1990s, do not try to tell healthcare administrators in Albany or anywhere else (including Washington, D.C.) that the New York approach has not enhanced the safety of coronary artery bypass in that state. They will not believe it. And from their perspective, how can you blame them?Brookand Choudhry et al.have described several possible liabilities of surgeon-specific outcome assessment, the most damaging of which are related to the perceived inevitability of public disclosure. The prospective audits in vascular surgery that have been proposed by the SVS/ISCVS-NA are meant to be held in confidence within each hospital for the expressed purposes of credentialing and quality control. We believe this confidence should be preserved, yet discretion and common sense may be too much to expect either from the investigative press or from hospitals that are scrambling for a competitive market share. The alternative, however, is far worse. It is ignorance. Hospitalsshouldknow their own results, and surgeons must be among the first, not the last, to insist on it. For nearly 50 years our two societies have conducted a proud and principled search for excellence in vascular surgery. These are uncertain times, but we cannot stop now.",
  "1995": "It isn't often that one has the opportunity to publicly express debts of gratitude to those who have significantly influenced and contributed to one's career. I would like to mention several outstanding men with whom I have worked and thank them for the time, direction, and counsel they have generously given to me. In 1950 Dr. Jack Cranley, a long-time prominent member of this Society, identified me as a talented scrub technician, and through his encouragement I set forth on my career path in medicine. He made it possible for me to attend medical school by providing summer and part-time employment during my high school, pre-medical, and medical school education. My educational experience was also highlighted by medical innovators, Dr. Al Star, Dr. Charles Dotter, Dr. A. G. Morrow, and Dr. Norman E. Shumway, who provided me with direction, insight, goals, and opportunities, for which I am forever grateful.One of the prerogatives attached to the presidential office of a major society includes the freedom to choose the subject matter for the presidential address. Reflection on my part resulted in the potential for two presentations. The one I have chosen not to give deserves mention.As physicians, we have after many years of denial finally come to accept that we indeed are in a service business. Our customers are our patients, and our job is prevention, maintenance, and repair.This address marks the 49th Presidential Address, and until today none of the former presentations have focused onprevention.At the risk of eliminating our livelihood, I thought it might be appropriate to give the first Presidential Address on the Prevention of Vascular Disease. I originally chose as my topic: The Therapeutic Benefit of Red Wine Drinking on the Cardiovascular System. Overwhelming evidence is now available that documents how the ravages of atherosclerosis can be delayed by moderate daily consumption of red wine. Components within the extract obtained from the red grape skin have a salubrious effect on the cardiovascular system. It has been documented that the extract that is released from the red grape skin upon ingestion causes decreased platelet adhesiveness, increased HDL level, decreased serum lipids, and arterial wall relaxation that persists well beyond the presence of a measurable blood alcohol level.This extract also has a beneficial effect on the endothelium. These therapeutic benefits related to wine ingestion have collectively become known as \u201cthe French Paradox.\u201dNitric oxide is found in high concentrations in the extract of the red grape and has been identified as one of the critical components in the resultant beneficial effect. These findings should then extrapolate to providing vascular surgeons with an excellent rationale for prescribing moderate red wine consumption for all of their patients. The author of this manuscript provides testimony that those wines bearing the Fogarty label are particularly beneficial in their antiatherogenic effect. However, despite the ever-increasing evidence extolling the positive health benefits of medicinal red wine consumption, as of this writing there is still no allowable reimbursement code for this type of counsel, nor is a prescription for red wine viewed as an acceptable drug. In addition, the FDA most certainly would have concerns about \u201coff-label use\u201d and appropriate dosages. Despite these obstacles to the adoption of this treatment method, as an enologist and physician I am hopeful that red wine might someday be considered a \u201cvalued drug\u201d by the FDA. However, because I feel a responsibility to depart my presidential office leaving information and a perspective that hasimmediateapplicability, I was forced to abandon this topic.Moving beyond that lighter medical note, I would like to address the socioeconomic and technologic changes that are occurring in the field of medicine and specifically how these changes impact our specialty.It is noteworthy that of the 48 former SVS presidents, only two have been private practitioners in the traditional sense. Although my early career and current activity is within an academic center, the major portion of my clinical experience was spent in a private practice environment. The election of a nontraditional president in this time of change indicates that our specialty, as represented by this Society, is willing to earnestly confront the issues that are influencing the way we currently practice vascular surgery.The last four decades have seen profound changes in the socioeconomic structure of medicine. Medical treatment is now considered a right, not a privilege. Demands are being placed on our medical clinicians and institutions to increase coverage while decreasing the costs for the resultant improved products and services. Currently 14% of the U.S. gross national product is committed to medical care. In an attempt to reduce this figure, managed care organizations have emerged as an insurance coverage system that significantly alters the way we practice medicine. Coalitions of hospitals, companies, and more importantly, coalitions of insurance agencies have developed into influential and powerful entities. These mega-organizations are new and unfamiliar to us, and as a specialty we are attempting to formulate a strategy to responsively interact with them. Concurrent with all these reforms, revisions, and restructuring to our environment, we have witnessed revolutionary advances in technology. In our specialty advances have occurred in the development of techniques, drugs, procedures, instruments, and improved services that are rapidly replacing our standard, conventional models. We are immersed in a technologic revolution in which altered socioeconomic forces require us now, more than ever, to question: \u201cWho we are, what we do, and where we are going.\u201d I will give my perspective on these important questions that face our specialty.WHO WE AREIf we respond individually, the answer is obvious and straightforward. Each of us is a surgeon who has gained additional training and expertise in the diagnosis, treatment, and management of vascular disease. When attempting to further define the question as a collective, the response becomes much more complex. Certainly, the response is not uniform. When questioning \u201cwho we are,\u201d the answer is couched in terms of what person, or what institutional affiliation serves to characterize us. For those in traditional private practice, the name of the hospital or clinic is used as an additional identifier. That physicians identify themselves with dissimilar descriptions serves to document that they not only perceive themselves as dissimilar, but in fact, function with very different perspectives. Physicians have segregated themselves into two camps: academicians and private-practice physicians. Despite having a partnership within the same specialty, academicians and private practitioners have remained quite distinct and separate. The relationship between the two camps has historically varied from good to bad or indifferent, and in some situations, has been downright confrontational.The criticism directed at one another over the years has been somewhat consistent. It is worth reviewing the activities and relationships that have been the source of this criticism. Private practitioners viewed academicians as elitist, somewhat artificial, and perceive that they are unrealistic, do not work hard, and are therefore economically deprived. They felt this group was more concerned with academic advancement than clinical care. Teaching and research were used as mechanisms to achieve that end. The academician did not address real-world issues, but instead created artificial environments protected by the socialistic structures that academic institutions tend to foster.In this unrealistic environment they taught, researched, and practiced medicine while failing to recognize how little their efforts influenced the real world of medicine. There are, however, some good attributes that private practitioners recognize. Academicians are influential, scientific, altruistic, current, and good teachers.In turn, the physicians associated with teaching and academic centers consider private practitioners wealthy or economically advantaged, uninformed, late-adopters, non-scientific, and not very influential. In addition, academicians have often held the view that private practice centers were environments where financial return became the most important issue of practice. Basic research was never done in these environments. Meaningful clinical research was rarely done, as this activity was considered time-consuming and expensive and did not bring value to the bottom line. Even when clinical research was performed, it was viewed with suspicion by academic centers. Practitioners were viewed as too busy to contribute to the teaching effort. When they did contribute, their value was often considered marginal. On the plus side, private practice physicians were considered efficient, practical, pragmatic, as possessing technical talent, and as being educable.The opinions that these two groups have of one another when analyzed honestly are unkind, and when stated succinctly results in these perspectives. The university physician perceives private practitioners as individuals whose pursuit of money often results in bad judgment. The private practitioner views the university-based physician as an individual who generates useless papers and meaningless titles. In fact, there are at times and in some situations, elements of truth in the statements made by each. Both groups are functioning to fulfill their own personal agendas, and each is partially correct in their assessment that the others' activities are self-serving. Academic advancement in and of itself is not bad, and should be viewed as an admirable goal. When this goal becomes so overriding that clinical care, teaching, and research become minor objectives, balance is lost. In this unbalanced environment, if inappropriate advancement occurs, those who follow also become unbalanced. The pursuit of wealth in and of itself, likewise, is not bad or evil. An overemphasis on wealth, however, can lead to inappropriate and unnecessary procedures that result in compromised patient care. More recently, unbridled competition on the part of both groups for patients has resulted in very destructive and inappropriate activity that has further separated these groups from cooperative efforts.The question one should ask is; \u201cDo these perceptions make any difference?\u201d As recently as 10 years ago a lack of or a poor relationship among these groups in most circumstances had little impact on their function. In the current environment, because of changing technology and socioeconomic issues, it has become crucial to not only relate to one another but also to work closely together to benefit our profession and the patients we serve. Traditional private practitioners and those associated with training centers are going to have to alter their attitudes, approaches, and relationships to one another if they are going to continue to enjoy their past successes. This relates to the most critical issue facing all physicians, both academic and private sectors alike: the ultimate viability of our teaching centers. Universities are dealing with a lack of research funding and decreasing financial support for postgraduate education. Fiscal efficiency is required if academic institutions are to remain intact as clinical centers. This effort should not be the sole responsibility of the academic community alone. It should be recognized that fiscally experienced private practitioners can have a vital role in this endeavor and should be involved in the joint process. As well, the Lifeline Foundation, as the research arm of the Society for Vascular Surgery and the International Society for Cardiovascular Surgery, North American Chapter, has been chartered to address the key issues of research and the education of young specialists in vascular surgery. We are obligated to support its efforts. If these actions are not initiated, our educational institutions will continue to be compromised or function at a low level, and the future of American medicine will be jeopardized.WHAT WE DO\u201cWhat we do\u201d may be answered simply: we are surgeons who operate on the vascular system, and we have been taught to do this by cutting and sewing. The university's traditional role is to provide direction, develop new procedures, and advance technology, and then to educate and promulgate this information to students, trainees, and those in active practice. To accomplish this goal totally independent of the private practitioner is difficult in some situations and is virtually impossible under certain circumstances.For example, many common general surgical procedures such as hernia repair and cholecystectomy are infrequently performed in many academic centers. Academic surgeons are unlikely to develop improvements related to procedures that they rarely perform. In fact, less-invasive general surgery was initiated and developed primarily by private-practice physicians.In the field of vascular surgery, as previously alluded to, a close relationship between the academic community and private practitioners is also lacking. The following statistics will serve to make this point. Of all major vascular procedures performed in the United States in 1994, between 10% and 12% were carried out in the university setting. Private institutions provided the setting for approximately 88% of these major vascular procedures. A review of the official Journal of our Society for the year 1994 revealed that 85% of the scientific articles that were published originated in university environments, whereas only 15% of them came from private institutions. To say that this is an imbalance is an understatement. Contributing university groups are reporting on a small and highly select segment of patients. The largest portion of clinical material is not being reported on and is very likely not being analyzed. The criticism is obvious. Private practitioners are not contributing to the extent they could be and should be. The academic community is reporting too much on too little. Our specialty would be better served if the literature reflected a cooperative and balanced case selection offered by both groups. This requirement becomes critically important when one considers that managed care organizations will mandate outcome data on the procedures we perform. It is no longer sufficient to provide the self-proclaimed best care concept that previously served to satisfy the patient, the patient's family, and the referring physician. Contracts for patient care will be awarded on the basis of cost, outcome analysis, and the ability to negotiate. Outcome analysis can only be understood when the entire spectrum of disease is considered. Private practitioners, in general, deal with less-complex clinical cases. Academic centers traditionally treat more advanced diseases and manage patient groups that present significant technical challenges. Because of this selection process, the reported literature can often indicate higher mortality and morbidity rates than actually exist. If one were to look at outcome analysis with this biased view of case selection, what is reported will not be representative of our specialty's efforts. We must become more cohesive in assessing and reporting what we do in a uniform fashion.Additional factors should serve to unify us. Powerful unifiers are the threats common to both private practitioners and academicians. These common threats are a decrease in influence, a decrease in independence, an increase in competition from other specialists, a decrease in financial resources, and the emergence of the general practitioner as gatekeeper. If we observe the shift in the balance of influence exerted by physicians on the therapeutic decision today contrasted to 1960, we would find a most interesting and disheartening occurrence.graphically illustrates this shift.In 1960 physicians made therapeutic decisions in consultation with the patient, the patient's family, and the referring physician. In 1995 we are dealing with a totally different decision model. Today players involved in influencing therapeutic decisions are the treating physician, the referring physician, insurance companies, government and regulatory agencies, industry, and hospital administration and staff. The balance has dramatically shifted. Physician input and influence has precipitously declined, and in its place we see a significant increase in the influence exerted by regulatory agencies and insurance companies in determining what we can do and how we may do it. This situation should not exist. A simple but important concept is founded in the principle that the therapeutic decision should ultimately be made at the highest level of knowledge and integrity. Those best qualified to make these decisions are physicians in the practice of medicine, caring for the individual patient.I would like to address the increasing and potentially adverse influence of government regulatory agencies. Two governmental agencies that have impacted us most profoundly are the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the Health Care Finance Administration (HCFA). Although there is insufficient time to address in detail the heavy influence of both organizations, I want to briefly mention how each impacts us in our daily practice of medicine.By law, the FDA has the responsibility of addressing safety and efficacy issues associated with the use of drugs and devices. This process is implemented and directed through guidelines and regulations developed by the agency. Proposed clinical protocols for investigational drugs and devices are submitted to the agency for review and approval. After protocol approvals and completion of studies, FDA panels either approve or disapprove submissions. It is obvious that the functioning of this regulatory process can significantly influence the availability of drugs and devices and the manner in which they are used. Inappropriate delays in the regulatory process can result in multiple adverse situations. Improved treatments are denied to patients and developmental costs are significantly increased when the approval process is lengthy. Regardless of the length of time that a properly structured study takes to complete, adverse effects are sometimes identified in small groups of patients. A common response of regulatory agencies when presented with this conflict is to delay decisions or to do nothing. They seek to avoid any possibility of adverse effects by these indecisive actions and instead add additional documentation requirements, which only serve to further lengthen the approval processing time. A simple retreat to erring on the side of safety has the potential of further harming the economic and health accruing benefits that may be garnered by applying new technology to medicine. It is important to recognize other areas that the FDA also influences. Three additional vital areas in need of reform are (1) the availability of biomaterials, (2) \u201coff-label\u201d use of drugs and devices, and (3) reimbursement for investigational devices. Recent internal government criticism directed toward \u201cthe agency\u201d (FDA) and mounting pressure from the drug and device industry have resulted in some very positive changes. The FDA has recently recruited increasing numbers of physicians who have clinical practice backgrounds and placed them in responsible positions where they advise regarding the nature and structure of clinical trials. Dr. Kessler has undertaken a departmental reorganization aimed at eliminating delays in the approval process for new drugs and devices. Abandoning the concept of applying drug study models to device study design has resulted in more appropriate device evaluations and subsequent decreased approval times.The HCFA, under the auspices of the Department of Health and Human Services, is responsible for administering federally funded medical insurance programs. In May 1994 this agency subpoenaed over 100 hospitals for patient billing and hospital records. The subpoena was requested for the purpose of documenting those patients who had devices used or implanted that were under FDA clinical trial auspices. The agency's implication was that these procedures should not have been reimbursed for either the professional or institutional components. All documents dating back to 1984 were requested. Institutional responses varied. Some refused to cooperate, whereas others formed coalitions of hospitals and filed suit against the agency for this action. Many institutions initiated internal audits in an attempt to satisfy the subpoena. A more dramatic response chosen by several major academic centers was to terminate clinical trials in progress and suspend consideration of any new studies. I consider this latter action gutless, totally inappropriate, contrary to the academic mission, and adverse to efforts seeking to improve patient care. Fortunately, in the interim it appears that HCFA has abandoned this investigation. The real question generated by this activity relates to a socioeconomic issue: \u201cWho should pay for investigational devices and drugs?\u201d The answers depend on several premises and determinations, but all relate to who receives value from the new drug or device and who provides that value. There are numerous potential givers and recipients of \u201cvalue.\u201d They are patients, hospitals, insurers, manufacturers, and physicians. Historically each of these value-givers and recipients have mutually benefited through technologic advancement, and they should continue to be allowed to do so without government intrusion. In this environment where government influence is becoming more dominant, physicians have additional obligations. As treating practitioners, we should work to effect attitudinal and legislative changes that would enable the regulatory process to become more user-friendly and efficient. If the above issues go unresolved, our patients will not receive the best and most current treatment, and the United States health care industry will continue to relocate offshore for both manufacturing and clinical investigation.WHERE WE ARE GOINGWhere we as a specialty will go will be determined by how we respond to current changes. Socioeconomic changes require us now, more than ever, to include economics in our decision-making process when considering a therapeutic approach. We will be required to choose a therapy based both on clinical and cost effectiveness, regardless of our training, background, or clinical perspectives. In particular, emerging endovascular technologies will displace some procedures traditionally managed by our standard surgical approach. In light of this change, it is interesting and timely that less-invasive technologies offer the possibility of reducing overall cost while still optimizing clinical benefits. The unanswered questions that remain are: \u201cHow much and how soon?\u201drepresents my perspective on the current status and future anticipated use of endovascular alternatives used to treat vascular disease.If these forecasts prove to be accurate on the basis of even the lowest projected numbers, vascular surgeons have limited options: adopt the new technology, reject the technology and do what is left, retire, or learn another profession. Depending on one's focus, commitment, and stage in life, any of the above options may be viable for a given individual. As a specialty that serves the interest of our patients, however, it is my recommendation that we become integrally involved in the appropriate evolution of endovascular technology. We should adopt what is useful and abandon what is not. If existing technology is abandoned it will be done because it is inferior to the new technology. When we accept this fundamental concept, barriers to future technologic advances will fall. The manner in which practicing physicians become a part of this process may differ depending on the environment. In some situations, a close collaborative relationship with a radiologist or cardiologist may prove to be the most viable approach. If these cooperative relationships are not accessible or workable, the surgeon may find it necessary to pursue endovascular technology independently. If this solo direction is chosen, it should be followed with a firm commitment to devote the time, focus, and energy required to obtain the skills necessary to master these techniques.The academic community has an obligation in this process. The traditional teaching centers have spent much of their training time emphasizing the number of techniques and procedures done by their graduates. Although this is important, too little time has been allotted to the process of critical thinking and judgment. The dedication to structure, discipline, and consistent repetitive behavior that has made us proficient may prove to be our Achilles' heel. Many of us have become so structured that we have failed to recognize the potential of competing technologies. The time has come for the academic institutions to question some of their basic premises. It is quite possible that they are not the only source of all knowledge.A broader and more global perspective on changes in specialty training should be considered by university programs. It is my belief that the traditional departmental structures have outlived their usefulness. They must either adapt to accommodate new ideas or be replaced with contemporary systems. It is important to recognize that current technology has allowed us to diagnose and treat in many ways that do not involve the use of our traditional surgical approaches: cutting and sewing under direct vision. Evaluation and adoption of endovascular technology is best accomplished in an environment that is in evolution. Because multiple specialists each possess individual talents involved in the treatment process, university centers should develop groups to effectively manage disease, regardless of their specialty training. This will involve breaking down and crossing traditional departmental boundaries. It is my firm opinion that functionally and fiscally integrated groups that consist of vascular surgeons, interventional radiologists, cardiologists, and cardiac surgeons will best administer care to patients with cardiovascular disease. The concept of a team management approach for treating disease will put individuals from different specialties together to address all aspects of the disease entities we treat. To be successful with this modern treatment model, we must minimize the large fiscal differentials that now exist between the different specialties, particularly if they are all operating within the same group. In addition, we must aggressively deal with the issues of managed care. As physicians, we will be obligated to concern ourselves with contractual arrangements, for if we do not, we will not have access to the diseases we have historically treated. Consequently, we will not become skillful with the appropriate uses of new technology and services. Vascular surgeons know more about the pathology, pathophysiology, natural history, and care of patients with vascular disease than any other physician group. It must follow then that if we are going to form multispecialty associations, it is appropriate that we maintain a dominant position within that organization. If the lion and the lamb are going to lie together, it is best to be the lion. Several universities and private practice groups have already embraced this concept and have constructed multispecialty vascular centers under the direction of vascular surgical specialists. It is my belief that only those who implement this approach will become the superior training centers and maintain their fiscal viability.Although there appears to be significant uncertainty and unrest in the medical world, it is my contention that the future is optimistic. As physicians attempting to influence the future, it is important to accept that we may not be adequately prepared in all areas. In the past physicians have achieved success by effectively practicing the familiar art and science of our profession. We must now also exert our influence on the social, economic, governmental, educational, and political issues that are currently impacting the way we care for our patients. It is well to remember that patients, as consumers, will be the arbitrators and final determinants of the future character of medical care. Physicians, however, as the only individuals who are the personal and \u201chands-on\u201d interface with patients, have the ultimate ability to influence their perspective. Whether we choose to exercise that influence depends on our ability to effectively communicate that we, as caring physicians, are acting in the patients' best interests. Activities and expressions that relay a contrary message must be avoided.In this time of turbulence and change, it is never more true that knowledge and wisdom are power. I believe that the Society for Vascular Surgery, along with our brother and sister societies, do possess that knowledge, wisdom, and power. I am quite confident that we as a specialty are going to do well if we choose to follow a constructive direction of dynamic change. The future is bright, the path is clear, and the responsibility is ours.",
  "1996": "Selection as President of The Society for Vascular Surgery is for me a singular honor, especially because it comes on the 50th Anniversary of this esteemed Society. However, this is a time of enormous upheaval in American medicine, and holding this office has also forced me to focus on the future of Vascular Surgery and how well it will survive these turbulent times. The resulting concern I have for the future of our specialty has prompted me to select Charles Darwin as the topic of my Presidential Address. It is certainly reasonable to wonder what possible relevance Darwin, the famous English naturalist and the father of the theory of evolution, could have to Vascular Surgery. In fact, the theory and principles of Darwin are important to our specialty, and I will explain why.The life and accomplishments of Charles DarwinCharles Darwin was born in 1808 to a wealthy medical family in Shrewsbury, England. His father, a fashionable physician, entered his young son in Edinburgh Medical School. However, young Charles fled in horror at the sight of his first operation. Because the choice of alternative careers was limited and his aptitude for the classics minimal, his father enrolled Charles in Christs' College at Cambridge University with the intent that he become a clergyman. At Cambridge, Darwin obtained the rudiments of a scientific education and was able to pursue his boyhood interest in the natural history of plants, birds, and insects. Indeed, until the defining event in Darwin's life, it appeared that he was destined to become yet another botanizing Victorian clergyman. That seminal event was his appointment as Naturalist on the naval ship,H.M.S. Beagle,which had been commissioned to make a surveying voyage of the unexplored nether regions of South America, including Patagonia and Tierra del Fuego ().This 40,000 mile, 5-year voyage included many adventure-filled inland expeditions that gave Darwin a view of the natural world from the Brazilian jungle to the peaks of the Andes. His observations led him to speculate about the relationship between extinct and contemporary species and to question the then-current view that animal and plant species, having been created by God in His infinite wisdom, are permanently fixed and immutable. Concepts born in Darwin's mind on the voyage of theBeagle,together with supporting evidence gathered on that trip, ultimately led to his definitive formulation of the theory of evolution inThe Origin of Species By Means of Natural Selection,published 23 years after the voyage.Darwin was not one to rush prematurely into print and had spent the two decades between the formulation of his theory and its announcement in wrestling with potential objections and collecting supportive facts. This caution was based on Darwin's recognition that his theory would contradict religious thinking and would therefore elicit a storm of hostility and opposition. As Mark Twain would subsequently say: \u201cLet a man proclaim a new principle and public sentiment will surely be on the other side.\u201d This statement certainly applied to Darwin's theory in his era. It is often applicable today, and it may apply to parts of this Presidential Address.The theory of biologic evolution was not new. By Darwin's own count, evolutionary ideas had been put forth by more than 30 predecessors going back to the ancient Greeks. Others, including Diderot, Lamarck, and Darwin's own grandfather, had previously expressed evolutionary concepts only to have them greeted by theologic indignation and discredited in favor of divine creation of fixed species. Darwin's unique accomplishment was to accumulate a massive body of exemplary evidence, bolstered by the newly emerging scientific disciplines of geology and paleontology, to support his theory. He was also the first to have the crucial insight that the cause of evolutionary change must lie within the reproductive process, which produced random unlimited variations. These random heritable variations placed certain offspring in a favored position to cope with the Earth's constantly changing environment. Darwin postulated that these favored forms were better able to survive and would go on to form species, all members of which would have the new favorable trait. These new species would hold a competitive advantage and would win out over less-favored forms or species in the constant struggle for survival that exists throughout the animal and plant kingdoms. The less-favored forms or species would then diminish in numbers and become extinct. This process was Darwin's \u201cNatural Selection.\u201d Species that were most fit by virtue of a particular trait to cope with an ever-changing environment would displace other less fit or less capable related species. In the universal struggle for existence, the former would survive while the latter would not. To describe this process, Darwin adopted a phrase used in 1852 by Herbert Spencer: \u201csurvival of the fittest.\u201d However, Darwin's use of the word \u201cfittest\u201d was in relation to a given environment and not on an absolute scale of perfection.Other aspects of Charles Darwin's life are inheritantly fascinating. On March 26, 1835, Darwin was heavily bitten by the Benchuca or great black bug of the Pampas.This \u201ckissing bug\u201d carriesTrypanosoma cruzi,the causative agent of Chagas' disease. Although the disease was not known until long after Darwin's death, it is likely that this infestation produced the lassitude and the heart and gastrointestinal disorders that troubled Charles Darwin throughout his life after the Beagle. These symptoms and the resulting semi-invalidism caused Darwin to shun society and other amusements and distractions, thereby giving him the opportunity to concentrate more fully on his work.Darwin's scientific accomplishments were prodigious and not restricted toThe Origin of Species.As shown in Table 1, his scientific interests spanned an enormous breadth within botany and zoology.Although some of his secondary works were related to his primary interest in evolutionary theory, others described innovative concepts regarding the formation of volcanic islands and coral reefs, the mechanisms of plant fertilization and reproduction, the power of movement in climbing and insectivorous plants, and landmark studies of the natural history of earthworms and barnacles. In time many of these concepts would become classics.After seriously debating with himself the pros and cons of marriage and its impact on his scientific career, Charles Darwin on January 28, 1939, at age 30, married his cousin, Emma Wedgewood, the daughter of the famous pottery maker Josiah Wedgewood ().He rationalized his marriage with the following: \u201cMy God, it is intolerable to think of spending one's whole life, like a neuter bee, working, working, and nothing after all. No, no, won't do \u2026 Marry, Marry, Marry Q.E.D.\u201dAfter marriage, Charles and Emma Darwin, who had 11 children, lived in London for 4 years. They then moved to a country home, Down House in Kent, where he wrote most of his books and articles ().Although Darwin's poor health was ascribed to hysteria, anxiety, and hypochondriasis, it is unlikely that a man with the physical stamina, fortitude, and bold spirit he showed during the arduous and adventure-filled voyage of the Beagle could be afflicted with these neuroses. The Benchuca and Chagas disease are far more likely explanations for the ill health that formed a backdrop for Darwin's work from the end of 1839 until his death at age 73 on April 19, 1882.What human qualities best define Charles Darwin? The keynote of his character was simplicity. His wife described him as \u201cthe most open, transparent man I ever saw. \u2026\u201d Darwin characterized himself as \u201ca great overgrown child\u201d committed to happy endings. He despised cruelty to man and animals, but he recognized that animal experimentation was important for scientific progress, which, in turn, he believed was essential to the betterment of mankind. In the latter part of his life, his religious beliefs centered around natural scientific laws rather than a Creator with unlimited power and compassion. Darwin's self-appraisal of his mental qualities indicated that he \u201chad become skillful in guessing right explanations and devising experimental tests. \u2026\u201d He believed he had \u201cno quickness of apprehension or wit \u2026\u201d but that he was \u201csuperior to the common run of men in noticing things which easily escape attention, and in observing them carefully.\u201d He attributed his success in science to \u201cmethodical habits, ample leisure from not having to earn my bread \u2026 and ill health, \u2026 love of science, unbounded patience, industry in observing and collecting facts, and a fair share of invention [and] \u2026 common sense.\u201dApart from the ill health, all these qualities would serve an aspiring young vascular surgeon well today.Despite the turmoil and controversy his theories had created, on his death the greatness of Charles Darwin and the revolutionary importance of his theory to the biologic sciences were recognized ().He was likened to Copernicus, Newton, and Faraday and was buried with appropriate honors in Westminister Abbey.The changing medical environmentBefore considering the uncanny relevance of Darwinian principles to Vascular Surgery, it is important to examine some of the forces of change ongoing in its medical environment. All of these threaten the status quo, and some are threatening to the very existence of Vascular Surgery as a specialty. These forces have been fully discussed elsewhere,but some bear reemphasis.The financial support structure for medical care is changing. To restrain escalating health costs, government funding is being curtailed and managed care systems are being introduced widely. These systems provide financial disincentives to use invasive treatments, such as those required by some vascular disease patients. They also tend to place control of the use of these procedures in the hands of generalists rather than the specialists who perform them. All of these changes will make it difficult for the vascular surgeon specialist to function and will increase competition for the reduced dollars that are available to provide care for vascular disease patients.A second major environmental change is the introduction of technologic improvements that permit less-invasive, more cost-effective treatments. In the vascular disease area this involves a host of endovascular treatments with catheters, balloons, atherectomy devices, stents, stented grafts, and various derivative devices. All of these endovascular treatments involve catheter-guidewire-imaging techniques. All are potentially threatening to vascular surgeons because they may prove equal to or better than open surgical treatments and because they may be administered by nonsurgical interventional specialists with background training in Radiology or Cardiology. Competition of these other specialists with vascular surgeons for patients and limited health care dollars is inevitable. Moreover, interventional radiologists and cardiologists sincerely believe their access to new catheter-based treatments justifies their expanding role in the management of patients who were previously cared for by vascular surgeons.Ever-increasing expansion of the workforce in these nonsurgical specialties and decreasing workloads provide further impetus for them to increase their activities in the realm of vascular disease treatment.A third change in the challenging environment that vascular surgeons face is the re-entrance of general surgeons into the vascular disease treatment field. Decreasing workloads in traditional general surgical procedures, the emphasis on generalist care, and the current antispecialty aura has prompted some leaders in general surgery to advocate broadening the training and role of general surgeons so that they can provide \u201cexpertise that at the present time is attributed to various subspecialties, both within and without the realm of traditional general surgery\u201d and can \u201cpractice to the fullest extent of the specialty.\u201dThis is a call to reverse the recent trend for younger general surgeons without special training and certification in Vascular Surgery tonotperform vascular procedures.If this call were heeded, it would negate the purpose of specialized training in Vascular Surgery, namely the provision of better care to vascular disease patients.Vascular Surgery came into being as a specialty when it became obvious that general surgeons and cardiothoracic surgeons were not achieving optimal results with vascular operations.The improved results of vascular operations, when performed by well-trained surgeons who focus their attention on them and perform them in adequate numbers, has been amply documented by a plethora of studies that are well summarized by Hertzer.Darwinism and vascular surgeryTo apply the theory and principles of Darwin to Vascular Surgery in its present changing environment demands that we equate a \u201cmedical specialty\u201d to a \u201cspecies.\u201d The validity of this equivalence becomes apparent if we recognize thatspeciesmay be defined as a group of individual plants or animals that all have a high degree of similarity, can generally interbreed or reproduce only among themselves, and that show persistent differences from allied species.Amedical specialtymay be defined as a group of individual doctors of medicine who, as a result of specialized effort and training in a defined field, have a high degree of similarity in their possession of a special, distinct body of scientific medical knowledge and technical ability that is not possessed in full by other specialists.They concentrate their practice in the well-defined and distinct area of their special knowledge and technical ability, and they have the capacity to reproduce themselves via recognized residency training programs with a defined curriculum and specified case and procedural experiences.Among the objectives of recognized medical specialties and their governing bodies or boards is that they act in the public interest by contributing to the improvement of medical care by establishing qualifications and by evaluating individuals who apply for certification.Establishment of new medical specialty boards \u201cmust be based on major new concepts \u2026 or substantial advancement in medical science. [They] must represent a distinct and well-defined field of medical practice.\u201dVascular Surgery incorporates a discrete body of knowledge and distinct skills. Many are major new advances. It differs from other specialties, and its members reproduce themselves by recognized residency programs in vascular Surgery. It, therefore, qualifies as a separatespeciesormedical specialty.Darwin's theory and principles of evolution and natural selection are particularly relevant to Vascular Surgery if we realize that medical specialties, like species, are engaged in a constant struggle for existence and survival. Our specialty, Vascular Surgery, is in competition with other specialties, Interventional Radiology and Cardiology, for the patients that are the wherewithall to survive and flourish. This competition is rendered more fierce by some of the previously noted forces of change that exist in our environment. These forces will also place us in competition with our more closely related progenitor specialty, General Surgery. The outcome of this competition and struggle for existence will be survival and flourishing with increased numbers for some specialties; for others it will be weakening and diminished numbers; for still others it will mean extinction.Although the pollyannas may say there will be work for all, medical specialties, like species and individuals, have an irresistible urge to procreate and generally exercise minimal restraint of their excessive reproductive capacity. This leads to unchecked increases in the numbers of individuals within a well-adapted species/specialty, which, as Darwin noted, assures the extinction of less-well-adapted forms that are competing for the same niche in the environment.This niche is defined by food supply and habitat in the case of an animal species and by patients in the case of a medical specialty. Thus the universal struggle for existence inevitably follows from the high rate at which all organic beings and medical specialists tend to increase. Although some suggestions have been made to limit the numbers of medical specialty trainees, these efforts have been limited by antitrust laws and by the obvious incentives, such as prestige and low-cost assistance, that accrue to individuals who direct training programs.Because a changing environment can and has in the past produced the extinction of innumerable species and some medical specialties and because such extinction is a consequence of poor adaptation to a changing environment, what can Vascular Surgery and vascular surgeons do to assure the survival of their specialty in the present circumstances? They must recognize that their species or specialty is not immutable or fixed by some Creative Power, but must constantly evolve to survive. Moreover, they must realize, as Darwin showed, that transmutation of species is the rule and that several current species or specialties may descend from a common ancestor or progenitor. In the case of surgical specialties, they have all descended from a common progenitor specialty, General Surgery, to become clearly defined and separate specialties. This has been the case for Neurosurgery, Orthopedics, Urology, Plastic Surgery and Cardiothoracic Surgery. It must also be so for Vascular Surgery, if it is to survive. Vascular surgeons must also recognize the applicability of the Darwinian principle that forms that most resemble the common ancestors of several current species or specialties often become extinct as their superior and better-adapted progeny with favorable variations displace them in the endless struggle for existence.Darwin's principle of divergence also applies to medical specialties as well as species. According to this principle, differences between species or specialties that are at first barely perceptible tend to increase steadily, causing the different species or specialties to diverge increasingly in character both from each other and from their common progenitor.After vascular surgeons recognize that Darwinian theory applies to medical specialties as well as species throughout nature, they must then address three specific issues to minimize the risk of extinction.Vascular surgeons must acquire endovascular skillsThere are two clear reasons why vascular surgeons must become competent with the catheter-guidewire-imaging techniques that will enable them to perform endovascular treatments. The first is that some of these treatments will prove to be safe and effective and will replace standard open surgical techniques. This is already true for percutaneous balloon angioplasty (PTA) and caval filters. As stents, endovascular grafts, and other newer treatments become perfected, it is possible that 40% to 70% of current operations will be replaced with less-invasive endovascular treatments.The survival of Vascular Surgery will depend on the ability of vascular surgeons to adapt and acquire the catheter-guidewire-imaging skills to perform some of the new endovascular procedures that replace vascular operations. If we do not, the need for our services will decrease, we will gradually be replaced, and our numbers will diminish heading toward eventual extinction. As Darwin noted, the \u201cdeath of a species [specialty] is a consequence of non-adaptation to [changing] circumstances.\u201dIt is true that some endovascular procedures are done efficiently by other interventional specialists. Accordingly, it should not be our goal to \u201ctake back\u201d diagnostic angiography or the simple catheter-directed treatments that are currently performed mostly by interventional radiologists. To do so is unnecessary and will lead to destructive turf battles.However, it is the newer endovascular procedures, many that require surgical as well as endovascular skills, that will replace a large proportion of vascular operations. It is these that vascular surgeons must be able to perform to survive and flourish. Most endovascular grafting and some complex stenting procedures that are performed with an open vascular component are typical examples.A second reason to acquire endovascular skills is that they can be effectively used to simplify and improve a variety of standard vascular operations. Fluoroscopically assisted thromboembolectomy is an example.Using intraoperative digital C-arm fluoroscopy, a variety of guidewires and double-lumen balloon catheters, it is now possible to perform safer, better thromboembolectomy of even heavily diseased arteries. This technique facilitates over-the-wire passage of the balloon catheter through tortuous, stenotic, clot-filled arteries. It permits visual control of the contrast-filled balloon as it is drawn through diseased arteries to remove the clot, thereby avoiding damage to diseased and normal arteries. It also facilitates complete clot removal and localization and minimally invasive endovascular treatment of significant inflow and outflow lesions.Intraoperative digital fluoroscopy and catheter-guidewire techniques also facilitate other vascular operations. These techniques enable over-the-wire balloon control of inflow or outflow arteries when infection, scarring, or location renders traditional surgical access difficult. A good example is a case with subclavian artery injury. These techniques allow precise localization of pressure gradients and they facilitate simple endovascular treatment of unexpected lesions. They can also provide more accurate, more complete intraoperative angiograms of arterial reconstructions along with their entire inflow and outflow tracts. With cinefluoroscopy, these improved arteriograms also provide a dynamic index of flow. Vascular surgeons from now on must use these endovascular techniques as an essential survival adaptation in a changing environment. Because the instrumentation is available, we must be able to use it. To do so will render us \u201cfit\u201d to survive. Not to use these techniques is analogous to flying blindly through clouds when good navigational instruments are available. It is a clear path to extinction.How will current vascular surgeons acquire these endovascular skills? Three steps are involved. One consists of gaining familiarity with endovascular tools, devices, and instrumentation and learning some basic principles regarding their usage, their indications, and their limitations. This information, together with the principles of radiation safety, can be acquired in a Basic Endovascular Techniques Course, which combines didactic teaching with hands-on experience in mock circulatory models. The Society for Vascular Surgery (SVS) and the North American Chapter of the International Society for Cardiovascular Surgery (ISCVS) have made a commitment to conduct such a course to familiarize vascular surgeons with current catheters, guidewires, sheaths, balloons, stents, and intravascular imaging techniques. The first offering of this course preceded this year's Annual SVS/ISCVS Meeting. It was a success and will be repeated if there is a demand for it.The second step in acquiring endovascular skills is for vascular surgeons to obtain supervised clinical experience. This will be required for the third step, credentialing, which is a local hospital function that will not be discussed further. With regard to clinical experience, some vascular surgeons already have enough to be considered competent. Those that do not can take several pathways to obtain this endovascular patient experience. All involve supervision by a skilled endovascular therapist.The easiest pathway is for the vascular surgeon to work collaboratively on his or her own patients in his or her own operating room or angiography suite by assisting at or performing the various endovascular manipulations under the tutelage of an experienced colleague, who can be a vascular surgeon, an interventional radiologist, or cardiologist. In such a collaborative setting the interventionalist can serve as a teacher and a consultant if a problem or difficulty is encountered. This training and clinical experience may be provided as part of a healthy and mutually beneficial collaborative relationship, such as an interdisciplinary partnership or a Vascular Disease Center. This is consistent with the observations of Darwin who recognized that one species may be dependent on another. Such species interdependence generally occurs between beings remote in the scale of nature, whereas the struggle for existence will generally be more severe between closely related species.To some extent such specialty interdependence already exists in the current collaborative relationships in which interventional radiologists provide vascular surgeons with high-quality angiograms and vascular surgeons provide surgical resources to interventional specialists for their complications or failures.When such mutually beneficial relationships are not present within an institution, vascular surgeons must obtain their clinical experience in endovascular techniques at another institution as a trainee for at least 1 to 3 months, depending on the vascular surgeon's level of proficiency and talent, or by performing endovascular procedures with a visiting preceptor who is a skilled endovascular therapist. When either extramural arrangement is required, the SVS/ISCVS should play a major facilitating role by helping to establish a system whereby the necessary experience can be obtained with adequate supervision. The guiding principle in all these arrangements for gaining endovascular experience must be the absolute well-being of the patient. If appropriate skills are not available to one or another member of the team caring for the patient, the procedure shouldnotbe performed. Whatever pathway is chosen, the degree of endovascular proficiency that the vascular surgeon trainee must attain will depend on the setting in which he will use his new skills. Greater proficiency will be required if the vascular surgeon will not have available immediate interventional consultation and support. Again, the advantages of healthy collaboration between vascular surgeons and other interventional specialists (radiologists, cardiologists, or both) are obvious.If we accept in the Darwinian sense that current vascular surgeons will have to develop some level of catheter-guidewire-imaging skills to be \u201cfit\u201d enough to survive, it is apparent that we must also assure the endovascular competence of our progeny. To this end, the Association of Program Directors in Vascular Surgery (APDVS) and the Residency Review Committee in Surgery (RRC-S), which oversees training requirements in our specialty, must mandate that Vascular Surgical residency programs provide adequate endovascular training and experience.Multidisciplinary Vascular Disease CentersThe need for vascular surgeons to possess and use endovascular skills has led to the suggestion that vascular therapists of the future be hybrids between vascular surgeons and interventional radiologists. Darwin has pointed out that hybrids between species are generally infertile and weaker than their forbearers and rarely displace them.It is unlikely that the hybrid vascular specialist of the future will be the exception to this rule. There will always be a niche in the medical world for a specialty/species with dominant operative skills to perform complex open operations, despite the need for these individuals to have some degree of endovascular skills. Similarly, there will always be a niche for those with dominant interventional or endovascular skills, despite the advantages of these individuals having some degree of basic open operative skills. The beneficial effects of having both kinds of specialists, each with some degree of these overlapping skills, working together in a true partnership are immediately apparent.Management of vascular disease patients would be based on what treatment mode was best and most cost-effective rather than on what procedure an individual physician could perform, who saw the patient first, or the resources (operating room or angiography suite) a given physician controlled. Optimal training and patient care would be greatly facilitated and turf issues would be minimized.The formation of multidisciplinary Vascular Disease Centers in hospitals and medical schools would certainly facilitate true collaborative partnerships between vascular surgeons and other specialists interested in vascular disease diagnosis and management. These other specialists include primarily interventional radiologists but also some interventional cardiologists and those committed to vascular medicine. Some efforts at creating such Centers have already been made in a number of institutions. However, few if any have functioned well.Because the advantages of such Vascular Centers and other forms of collaborative partnership are so obvious, one wonders why they have functioned poorly and are not already widespread. One reason is the traditional administrative structure in most hospitals and medical schools in which Vascular Surgery is a component of General Surgery and Interventional Radiology is a component of Radiology. Because both of these components are large income producers for their parent departments, there is a natural reluctance to give them the financial or administrative independence to combine and form a new entity linked by their interest in vascular disease rather than their historical derivation from a progenitor specialty. Other reasons are inability to achieve financial integration between specialists, dominance of one or another specialty, and excessive control by the parent Departments of Surgery, Radiology, or Medicine. Underlying all these reasons are the major human motivators, jealousy and greed. Hopefully the enormous benefits of fully integrated Vascular Disease Centers will eventually overcome these negative forces.To this end, the clear advantages offered by Vascular Disease Centers prompted the Joint Council of the SVS/ISCVS and the Executive Council of the Society for Cardiovascular and Interventional Radiology (SCVIR) to approve a joint statement of support for Vascular Disease Centers. The SVS/ISCVS/SCVIR document recognizes that these Centers, if appropriately structured, will deliver the highest-quality diagnosis, treatment, research, and teaching in vascular diseases. The document mandates that such Centers be comprised of professionals whose primary interest and commitment is to vascular disease patients and that the Centers be administratively independent and co-directed by an interventional radiologist and a vascular surgeon. The document also specifies that all Center patients be cared for on a single integrated service, with management decisions being reached only after joint discussions between members of the two or more involved disciplines. All professional fees accruing to individuals in such a Center would be pooled and distributed on the basis of each individual's overall responsibilities and contributions to the Center. Interdisciplinary training and research would be fostered.Although resistance to real Vascular Disease Centers based on this document will come from a number of quarters, they will come into being and they will succeed for several reasons. Such Centers will reduce costs. They will provide optimal patient care. They will facilitate the rapid evaluation of new and better treatments. They will minimize the turf battles that might otherwise occur as the result of the shrinking financial support for health care and the introduction of new technologies which cross specialty boundaries. And most importantly, they are intrinsically right because they combine the assets and minimize the liabilities of the many specialties interested in vascular disease management.Relationships between Vascular Surgery, the American Board of Surgery, and the RRC-SThe American Board of Surgery (ABS) and the RRC-S are the governing bodies of General Surgery and Vascular Surgery. The ABS defines the boundaries of General Surgery and administers the examination that certifies general surgeons. The ABS also defines Vascular Surgery and administers the examination for Added Qualifications in that specialty. The RRC-S determines requirements for training and accredits residency programs in both General Surgery and Vascular Surgery. Both the ABS and the RRC-S presently consider Vascular Surgery a component of General Surgery and hold the view that General Surgeons should be trained and qualified to practice Vascular Surgery.This creates a potential problem or conflict. This stems from the fact that we are training two classes of \u201cvascular surgeons,\u201d one which is considered competent by all and holds a certificate to that effect, and a second class that is less well-trained but deemed by some qualified to perform Vascular Surgery\u2014or at least \u201csimple vascular operations.\u201d This problem is exacerbated by the fact that the governing bodies forbothrelated specialties are the same ABS and RRC-S. This arrangement may be beneficial when the interests of both specialties coincide, e.g., with reimbursement issues or conflicts with other less closely related specialties. However, when the interests of General Surgery and Vascular Surgery diverge, the governing bodies must favor one of two conflicting interests.One specific example is the recent mandate from the RRC-S that all general surgical residents perform at least 10 aortic cases.Many Vascular Surgery program directors were concerned about this new requirement since aortic surgery is diminishing because of PTA and stenting techniques. This concern was verified by an APDVS survey, which showed that this mandate threatens the viability of at least 28% of Vascular Surgery training programs.The result could be maintenance of the numbers of less well-trained \u201cvascular surgeons,\u201d i.e., General Surgeons, at the expense of decreased numbers of well-trained \u201creal\u201d vascular surgeons. How can this be reconciled with the objectives of medical specialization and Specialty Boards \u201cto act in the public interest by contributing to the improvement of medical care \u2026\u201d and to \u201c\u2026 promote and enhance recognition of a single standard in preparation for practice in each specialty\u201d?Clearly it cannot on a long-term basis.The only short-term justification for doing so is the fact that enough well-trained, certified vascular surgeons do not presently exist to perform all the Vascular Surgery procedures required in the United States.It seems reasonable, therefore, to continue to train General Surgeons to fill this gap until adequate numbers of well-trained \u201creal\u201d vascular surgeons can be produced. Consensus was reached on this issue at a recent meeting between leaders of the SVS/ISCVS, the APDVS, and the ABS held on April 29, 1996. At that meeting it was also agreed that the role of the RRC-S, which was not represented, was also important in resolving this problem and related conflicts. It was, however, agreed that better representation of Vascular Surgery, i.e., the APDVS and the SVS/ISCVS leadership, on the RRC-S was urgently required. The meeting ended on a note of optimism that compromise within the present ABS/RRC-S system could lead to resolution of the conflicting needs of Vascular Surgery and of General Surgery. Hopefully this optimism will be justified by the future actions of our governing bodies.However, there is little in the history of the relationship between Vascular Surgery and these governing bodies to justify such optimism. Although all vascular surgeons recognize the importance of including a rich Vascular Surgery experience in General Surgery training, issues similar to those present today have received the attention of SVS/ISCVS leaders for more than 26 years.In 1970, when discussing the value of training General Surgery residents in simple vascular procedures, Wylie wondered how many of these programs \u201cwould qualify a surgeon for appendectomy who could not remove the right colon. \u2026\u201dMore recently, approval of Vascular Surgery training programs has depended more on the quality of Vascular Surgery training afforded General Surgery trainees than the Vascular trainees themselves.In addition, graduates of adequate independent or freestanding Vascular Surgery training programs have been denied access to the certification process simply because their training was not in an institution with a General Surgery residency.These actions are not consistent with a policy of quickly producing adequate numbers of well-trained Vascular Surgeons, and will tend to maintain the status quo of the two or three class system.This problem must be resolved soon. The overriding reason is so thatSurgery at large can serve the public better.Our governing bodies must answer to this call rather than to the parochial interest of any surgeon group or other power base. To reach this goal your leaders in Vascular Surgery can continue our dialogue with the ABS and the RRC-S to obtain better representation for the SVS/ISCVS and the APDVS on these governing bodies. We can maintain steady pressure to see that the needs of Vascular Surgery, our training programs, and, most importantly, the patients we serve are met, so that we can train enough real Vascular Surgeons and provide optimal care to all vascular disease patients\u2014as has already occurred in many other industrialized countries. To maintain a consistent even-handed approach to this problem, the SVS/ISCVS last year formed a Strategic Planning Group that will address this and other issues critical to Vascular Surgery on a long-term basis. Some of these other issues include training in new techniques, workforce analysis, relationships with other specialties and other vascular societies, and vascular research funding.On all these issues, your leaders can provide analysis and point the way toward resolution. However, problems facing Vascular Surgery may require action and sacrifice and will only be solved if there is consensus and commitment fromall\u201creal\u201d Vascular Surgeons. In this regard, I define a \u201creal\u201d Vascular Surgeon as aSpecialist in Vascular Surgery or one who has completed at least 1 year of senior level training in Vascular Surgery and vascular disease management, who devotes more than 50% of his or her practice to vascular disease patients, and who performs more than 50 major vascular operations per year.Although this definition extends beyond the membership of the SVS and ISCVS and it certainly extends beyond the Certificate of Added Qualifications in Vascular Surgery, actions begun in the last year will hopefully lead to ISCVS membership for all such individuals. Clearly the well-being of vascular disease patients will be best served if they are cared for by such specialists.Charles Darwin has some concluding comments. Vascular Surgery is differentiating from its ancestor, General Surgery. Even though there is a continuing struggle for existence between the two, this will be resolved by the \u201cconstant tendency [of] the improved descendants of any one species \u2026 to supplant \u2026 the predecessors and original parent\u201d species.Vascular Surgery's descent and separation are inevitable because its members are better adapted, more \u201cfit\u201d by virtue of training and experience to care for vascular disease patients. The divergence of Vascular Surgeons from their ancestral forms will increase with time and be enhanced by increasing special knowledge involving improved operative techniques, vascular biology, noninvasive vascular laboratory techniques, and especially endovascular techniques. Indeed it is likely that endovascular treatments and proficiency in their use will be analogous to the cystoscope in separating Urology from General Surgery, and the pump-oxygenator in separating Cardiothoracic Surgery from General Surgery.And finally, Darwin would predict that forces of evolution will result in the distinct separation of our specialty, with our own recognized Specialty Board and related Residency Review Committee. That certainly would eliminate much conflict of interest and would probably be best for all concerned, especially for vascular patients.",
  "1997": "Vascular surgery has evolved by quantum leaps during the past five decades. The scientific practice of vascular surgery is exceedingly complex and, combined with the intricacies of dealing with health care providers and well-intentioned social planners, as well as diverse distractions by both our surgical and medical colleagues, challenges the simplest of our efforts. This dissertation addresses an important event in our history, the formation of the American Board of Vascular Surgery, the seeds of its evolution, the reactions to its inception, and a reflection as to what it means to our patients and our discipline.Development of a specialty in any profession fosters greater in-depth knowledge and advances the field's stature, but it carries the additional caveat in medicine of enhancing patient care. Unfortunately, in some surgical disciplines greater knowledge and more visible stature at times do not appear to have improved care of the patient. This has been of great concern to many of us in leadership positions in your Societies. Some attribute this to a belief that specialists can't render total care and that patients in general will be poorly served by such specialists who have fragmented the system. I don't accept this tenet or its implication. Others believe that mediocre performance of subspecialty care is an increasing problem. I do share their concern.A few facts seem incontestable. First, extraordinary amounts of new information have caused many surgeons to specialize simply in order to maintain basic competence in their clinical practices. Second, specialists who undertake greater numbers of specific procedures usually achieve better outcomes. Third, although the generalist was by necessity important because of inaccessible specialty care decades ago, contemporary information systems and economical means of transportation have made specialized care available for most of society. This is not to discount those impoverished or uninsured individuals who have difficulty gaining access to any health care providers, be they generalists or specialists.Evolution of the American Board of Vascular SurgeryThe American Board of Vascular Surgery had its roots in our Societies long ago. Specialty training in vascular surgery became the focus of attention more than 25 years ago by leaders of both The Society for Vascular Surgery (SVS) and the North American Chapter of the International Society for Cardiovascular Surgery (ISCVS-NA). Edwin J. Wylie in 1970 suggested that standards of excellence for vascular surgery could be reached by the establishment of specific residency training programs,and the need for these programs was echoed in 1971 by Jack A. Cannon, who noted that lack of proper training and operations performed by occasional vascular surgeons did not serve patients well.During this same time period, James A. DeWeese, F. William Blaisdell, and John H. Foster had been appointed as a committee of the Inter-Society Commission for Heart Disease Resources under the auspices of the American Heart Association. In 1972 they published a classic document on methods to provide optimal training and practice in vascular surgery, including a recommendation that certifying bodies of the American Board of Surgery (ABS) and the American Board of Thoracic Surgery (ABTS), or a sub-board of either or both boards, develop examinations in vascular surgery.Over the next few years the issue of training and certification was discussed widely among members of our Societies, and in 1972 Keith Reemtsma and Dr. Wylie submitted a resolution approved by both Societies recommending that the ABS issue certificates in vascular surgery. Both the American College of Surgeons and the American Surgical Association lent support to this recommendation, and in 1973 Dr. Wylie presented his proposal to the ABS, which approved his resolution in principle but asked for a more detailed proposal. Dr. Wylie presented his revised proposal to the ABS in 1974, yet the board was still not prepared to proceed with certification of vascular surgeons. Instead they established a standing committee to be known as the \u201cCommittee for Vascular Surgery,\u201d which at the time of its inception included Dr. Wylie, Jessie E. Thompson, D. Emerick Szilagyi, and W. Sterling Edwards.The ABS Committee for Vascular Surgery wasn't able to move the ABS. No further action on Dr. Wylie's proposal was taken during the next year by the ABS, nor was there any action after a second year. At that juncture, the Joint Council of the two vascular Societies appointed its own committee on vascular surgery training. The response of the ABS 1 week after the establishment of our committee was that discussions of certification of vascular surgeons were premature and should not be considered at that time. Three years had been spent in developing guidelines for training programs that were not acceptable to the ABS. Nevertheless, a year later these guidelines were accepted by the Residency Review Committee in Surgery (RRC-S) given the earlier general support of the American College of Surgeons and the prior acceptance in principle by the ABS. This was remarkable and acknowledged that vascular surgery training was different.This RRC-S training program proposal was forwarded to the Liaison Committee for Graduate Medical Education (LCGME), the group required to accept the guidelines for training programs, but the proposal was tabled because of an objection from the ABTS. Furthermore, the LCGME was not in a position to approve a training program for which there was no certificate, and the ABS was not about to provide one at that time.At that point, in 1979, the presidential address given by Dr. Blaisdell to The Society for Vascular Surgery challenged the vascular surgery community to proceed and assume a leadership role in establishing minimum standards of training in vascular surgery.That year the Societies proposed their own committee to proceed with evaluation and accreditation of vascular surgery training programs composed of Edwin J. Wylie, James A. DeWeese, W. Sterling Edwards, H. Edward Garrett, and Jessie E. Thompson, the so-called \u201cProgram Evaluation and Endorsement Committee\u201d\u2014the PEEC group. In 1980, perhaps because of this self-generated activity on behalf of the Vascular Surgical Societies, the ABS, the ABTS, and their two corresponding RRCs changed their tack and unanimously approved guidelines for training programs in vascular surgery. Final approval by all regulatory groups including the American Board of Medical Specialties (ABMS) occurred in November 1982, more than a decade after the proposal had been initially developed by our Society leadership. In 1982 the first certifying examination was administered to 14 members of the ABS and ABTS, and 2 years later, in 1984, the RRC-S accredited its first training program.In 1984 there was great concern expressed by the leadership of your Societies regarding a number of issues, including representation of vascular surgeons on the ABS and RRC-S, as well as specific case numbers being required to allow individuals to sit for the certifying examination. Sound familiar? That was more than 13 years ago. The seeming resolution of these issues was laborious, but by 1986 the certificate's annotation of qualifications was changed from \u201cSpecial\u201d to \u201cAdded,\u201d and direct admission to the written qualifying examination after training became possible.The designation of \u201cSpecial\u201d qualifications on the ABS Certificate proved to be a contentious issue. Many on the ABS believed that this was a unique certificate that did not solely relate to the surgeons' performance of vascular procedures, but instead recognized additional special contributions to the discipline of vascular surgery, including research, publications and presentations, teaching of students and trainees, academic appointments, as well as membership and participation in regional and national vascular societies.Others, including many leaders of our Societies, believed that this devalued the purpose for the certificate, which was to recognize training in vascular surgery, training that was meant to improve patient care in later practice. The ABS interpretation of what \u201cspecial\u201d meant clearly made certification elusive to many individuals and created an aura of elitism to the efforts of our predecessors. Transference of this action from the ABS leadership to our Societies did not enhance our reputation among real-world practitioners, but we were not the culprits in this matter.The purpose of my detailing these early happenings between the vascular surgery community and the ABS is to establish the fact that difficulties in communicating and resolving differences of opinion between these groups did not arise during the past few years but have been present since the earliest days of our specialty.Nevertheless, progress in the evolution of vascular surgery as a specialty occurred. Much of this progress was due to the effects of many vascular surgeons who served as Presidents of our Societies and Directors of the ABS during the past 25 years, including Drs. Barker, Blaisdell, Connolly, DeWeese, Ernst, Fry, Greenfield, Mannick, Rutherford, Thompson, and Willman.Having had 15 years of experience with formal ABMS-recognized training programs in vascular surgery, it would seem logical to ask what impact this has had on patient care. After all, that's what we're supposed to be all about. On first pass, it appears that care is better, albeit seemingly provided by fewer but better-trained surgeons. Two basic questions must be addressed. Will we continue to train sufficient numbers of surgeons in the United States to care for this country's patients as we enter the next millennium? Will these surgeons provide quality care? My qualified answer is yes to both questions, but only if we and others change the way we train and the way we certify, as well as the way we practice.The first issue I wish to call to your attention relates to numbers. If we attempt to ensure sufficient numbers of physicians to provide quality care of patients with vascular disease, we must understand workforce needsand recognize certain limitations of our current training programs. This issue is particularly relevant because of the 75 million baby boomers' entrance into our patient pool, with an almost unbelievable 73% increase in those older than 65 years occurring from the years 2010 to 2030 and a subsequent increase in operative interventions from 232 to 313 procedures per 100,000 population based on age changes of the United States populace alone. If such were the case, the total number of operations that would need to be performed in 2020 would be 1,020,000. Vascular surgeons were responsible for approximately 51% of the total operations performed 5 years ago, and if the activities per surgeon remain unchanged, then 3042 vascular surgeons would be required to provide 51% of the 1,020,000 operations needed in 2020, yet the product of our current training programs will provide only 2370 such surgeons. That's a shortfall of 672 vascular surgeons. Given the length of training needed to enter practice, we would be required to train nearly 30 additional fellows a year starting now to meet these needs. This seems like a very large number, and I am not advocating that we immediately increase our programs to meet this need. However, I might point out to you that this projection assumes that the general surgeons will continue to also contribute as they have in the past, which does not appear likely. But just say they do, then in 2020 they will be responsible for approximately 150,000 operations. Vascular surgeons will perform approximately 400,000 operations in that year. The total of 550,000 is unfortunately well short of the 1,020,000 operations required by United States society at that time. Who will provide the additional half million procedures? General surgeons, given their own interests, are continuing to enter advanced training in specialties where later vascular surgical practices are unlikely to evolve.In addition, individual malpractice costs as well as restriction of hospital privileges to perform vascular surgery because of institutional liability support the tenet that the small numbers of vascular operations performed by general surgeons today could well become smaller, which would place an even greater workload on the vascular surgery community.Because the numbers required to train general surgeons are mandated by RRC-S criteria, many of us as teachers are boxed in without sufficient operative cases available at many institutions to train additional ABS-eligible vascular surgeons. Limitations in the ability to train additional vascular surgeons is unfortunate, because the data are clear that most general surgeons do not use their training experiences in vascular surgery to care for patients with vascular disease in their later careers. To a lesser extent, this is magnified by an inability to certify vascular surgeons who completed training in PEEC-approved programs that were not RRC-S\u2013approved because their institution did not provide for general surgery training.The ABS has remained steadfast in its perception that the totally trained general surgeon at the completion of residency is able to perform vascular surgery well. They may be well trained, but they don't carry this into their practice.It seems critical to differentiate surgical training from surgical practice. This becomes a societal problem if we use case material to train but we don't produce a surgeon who will care for these patients. Even when you modify future operative needs by 20% or 30%, which might indeed occur with mandated changes in health care or introduction of new technology such as endovascular therapies, we still fall short in the predicted number of vascular surgeons available to care for society's needs in 2020.Quality care is the second issue I wish to call to your attention. Data do not favor the occasional surgeon performing vascular surgery. Endarterectomy of the carotid artery is a good example. It is among the most common vascular surgical procedures performed, the indications for it are reasonably well defined, the technical challenges of the procedure are not great, and many practitioners believe they are vested in the requisite skills to perform this procedure. Nevertheless, data document that those who perform fewer operations have much poorer outcomes than those who perform this procedure on a regular basis, and the latter are predominantly vascular surgeons, not general surgeons. In the State of Iowa, where there appeared to be an unacceptably high stroke rate after carotid endarterectomy, a careful audit of actual medical records, not a review of discharge data, on all 806 carotid endarterectomies performed on Medicare patients in 1994 revealed a combined cerebrovascular accident and mortality rate for procedures performed by ABS-certified vascular surgeons of 5.2% compared with 8.4% for procedures performed by nonvascular surgeons (personal communication, Timothy F. Kresowik, MD, University of Iowa and the Iowa Foundation for Medical Care). The 3.2% difference represents an incremental increase in stroke and death in excess of 60%. I would ask you the simple question whether it is reasonable for a patient to accept a 3.2% risk of having a stroke or losing one's life just for the convenience of being treated by someone who believes that they are well trained in this procedure, compared with a vascular surgeon who has outcomes that are substantially better.We are not talking about turf or egos, and we shouldn't be talking about economics; we are talking about lives and the benefits of specialization as they relate to one of the most simple technical procedures in vascular surgery, certainly much less complex than the performance of an abdominal aortic aneurysmectomy or infrapopliteal bypass grafting. Norman R. Hertzer was absolutely correct in his presidential address to us 5 years ago\u2014results mean everything.Experiences such as those in Iowa do not favor treatment by the nonvascular surgeon. Either we need to train these surgeons differently or they need to practice differently. The Strategic Planning group of your Societies, composed of the two Past Presidents, the two current Presidents, the two President-Elects, as well as the two Secretaries, met after the 1996 annual meetings and considered how to establish a more forthright and effective dialogue with the ABS and RRC-S. It was in an attempt to resolve these issues of numbers of surgeons and the quality of their care that your leadership concluded that carrying on as usual would not suffice; they believed that pursuit of a new Board for vascular surgery was an appropriate evolution of our specialty.In September 1996, the eight of us\u2014William A. Abbott, William H. Baker, Jerry Goldstone, Robert B. Smith III, Jonathon B. Towne, Frank J. Veith, Anthony D. Whittemore, and myself\u2014proceeded with the incorporation of the American Board of Vascular Surgery. This action was carefully conceived with legal counsel and quiet input from many others. It was meant as a preemptive move. We own the name of the Board. The cost of creating this Board and the effect it would have on our influence on American medicine were carefully weighed, and we felt confident that this was the right thing to do and the right time to do it. Our action was subsequently announced to the Executive Committee of the Program Directors in Vascular Surgery; Robert W. Barnes as President of the Program Directors in General Surgery; Calvin B. Ernst and Richard H. Dean, representing two vascular surgeons on the ABS; Jay Grosfeld and Wallace P. Ritchie, Jr., the Chairman and Executive Director of the ABS, respectively; and Paul A. Ebert, Director of the American College of Surgeons. This occurred during a series of sequential meetings on the same day in October 1996.Reaction to the American Board of Vascular SurgeryThe response to our action might have been predicted. It caused considerable unrest among certain general surgeons. However, it subsequently resulted in a number of ABS and RRC-S reactions addressing symptoms of our past concerns. Many of these responses are viewed favorably by your leadership, including the option to recertify in general surgery rather than having it as a mandatory requirement before recertification in vascular surgery; RRC-S tabling of the requirement of specific numbers of aortic cases to be performed by all general surgeons, which would have placed nearly a quarter of vascular surgery training programs in jeopardy; and the appointment of two vascular surgeons to the RRC-S and the anticipated appointment to the ABS of an additional vascular surgeon to be nominated by the Program Directors in Vascular Surgery. These actions have been a welcome respite, but they don't get at the root of our concerns, namely, the issues of trainee numbers and quality of patient care.The ABS Executive Director's missive of March 1997 was not viewed favorably by your leadership. This document, sent to the approximately 28,000 ABS certificate holders, misinterprets the actions of the vascular surgery leadership. Dr. Robert B. Smith III, my counterpart as President of the North American Chapter of the International Society for Cardiovascular Surgery, and myself first met with the Executive Director and Chairman of the ABS in October 1996 and clearly stated that we did not believe that the training of general surgeons in vascular surgery should be eliminated, although it should be modified. We made this matter plentifully clear by stating that should the vascular community have a Board succeed, a contractual agreement with the ABS and RRC-S mandating continued training of general surgeons in vascular surgery should exist for at least two decades. How this could be interpreted to represent our lack of interest in the training of general surgeons is not apparent. Although this ABS communication may have represented a defining moment for the ABS, it polarized much of the general surgery and vascular surgery communities and jeopardized open and truthful dialogue between the ABS and the vascular surgery community. We have not gone as public in our response to the ABS as did their Executive Director, but we have communicated to him directly in writing and have made a number of our specific concerns known to the ABS through correspondence from one of their Directors, Calvin B. Ernst, who had been nominated to the ABS by our Joint Societies.The vascular surgeons who represent your Societies are not intellectual terrorists. Our concerns are that lives are at stake, not reputations of organizations or the egos of their leadership. The ABS through their recent communication revealed an exceptional talent for making vascular surgeons look petty, but in the rush to condemn us two things were forgotten\u2014our surgical trainees and our patients. The hubris that the ABS should be applauded for being the arbiter and caretaker of vascular surgery's future is not borne out by their actions of the past 25 years. We should dutifully avoid the unwarranted glee, as well as undo pessimism, that prevails in some circles surrounding our recent dealings with the ABS. Respect for the ABS should not be viewed as a compromise, and recognition of all that they have done for our discipline is not a capitulation to their directives. We really should not be at odds with the ABS. We need a solution, not hierarchical dictates from anyone, be they from ourselves, other surgical organizations, or the ABS. Time is not a luxury in this effort. Given the changing face of medical practice, indolence may be the greatest threat to our specialty. We will not keep our vigor and coherence if we are too timid to engage, challenge, or inspire.In our last public communication to you, which was published in modified form in the February 1997 issue of the Journal of Vascular Surgery, the leadership of The Society for Vascular Surgery, the North American Chapter of the International Society for Cardiovascular Surgery, and the Association of Program Directors in Vascular Surgery asked for your support at pursuing our request to establish a primary Board within the ABMS.It was signed by the Councils of both Societies and the Association of Program Directors in Vascular Surgery. There have been few times in our recent history that such unanimous resolve has been publicly expressed.The response to this communication from the Society members residing in the United States was enlightening and revealed differences among vascular surgeons who were ABS-certified and those who were not, as well as differences by the age of those queried (Table I).A total of 1276 replies were received, of which 139 or 11% were undecided. Among those who rendered an opinion, 906 favored our actions and 231 did not. Thus 80% of those members with an opinion favored the formation of the American Board of Vascular Surgery. Perhaps most important were the responses from the questionnaires sent to the 815 Society members who hold ABS certificates in vascular surgery. Responses were received from 767 such members, with only 48 failing to reply. Among those ABS-certified vascular surgeons who responded, 644 favored our action, only 60 disapproved, and 63 were undecided. Thus of ABS-certified vascular surgeons who rendered an opinion, 91% favored pursuing ABMS recognition of the American Board of Vascular Surgery. This ABS-certified group was decidedly younger than the noncertified respondents and are likely to be the future voice of our Societies. This positive response would not have been predicted a little over a decade ago,but the inevitability of vascular surgery having its own Board and RRC was predicted by Dr. DeWeese, one of our most knowledgeable leaders, a year ago on the 50th anniversary of the Society for Vascular Surgery.Future Actions Concerning the American Board of Vascular SurgeryThe scope of establishing the American Board of Vascular Surgery has been politically tedious, if not daunting. Although the proposed American Board of Vascular Surgery meets the ABMS criteria to become a Primary Board,discussions by the eight of us who founded the Board on your behalf have included consideration of establishing a Conjoint Board rather than a Primary Board. From an operational perspective, a Conjoint Board is similar to a Primary Board in that it defines criteria for individuals to sit for examinations and it certifies those who pass these examinations. It may also request development of a Residency Review Committee for its Specialty. The difference between a Primary Board and Conjoint Board is that the Directors of the Conjoint Board are appointed by one or both of two sponsoring ABMS Boards,which in our case would be the ABS and the ABTS. The ABTS has a great deal at stake in what we do regarding further specialization and training, in that 35% of their certificate holders currently perform 50 or more vascular procedures a year.Appointment of directors by the ABS and ABTS to the American Board of Vascular Surgery as a Conjoint Board would come from nominations from Societies such as ours, the Program Directors in Vascular Surgery, the Regional Vascular Societies, the Advisory Council for Vascular Surgery of the American College of Surgeons, and other organizations with direct interests in the treatment of vascular disease.The policies of a Conjoint Board must be in conformity with those of the two sponsoring boards, yet the day-to-day operations would not be hindered by the reoccurring problems that have existed with those presently responsible for controlling our training programs and certifying us as practitioners. This is a positive situation from our perspective, in that the ABS will maintain indirect control of one of the important parts of the Discipline of Surgery. Furthermore, the ABTS will be included in dealing with relevant training and practice issues much more than they have with the ABS and RRC-S. It also will be very positive for us, in that we will be operationally able to function in a more efficient and independently effective manner. Novel and more timely adaptation of training programs are certainly going to be necessary at meeting our discipline's needs in the years ahead.Our mission should be to maintain and improve the health care of patients with vascular disease, and we should not, by choice, expend considerable energy on political polemic. However, if we don't address the issues as to whether we will have enough vascular surgeons properly trained to care for patients as we enter the next century, then we will have been derelict to our profession and to society.The ABS and RRC-S face many difficulties, only one of which is the challenge that has been laid before them by your Societies' leadership. Most of these relate to residency and fellowship training issues, but they all have arisen because the current educational process is in need of restructuring.Specialization will invariably cause some degree of fragmentation, and certification in the real world provides improved opportunities for physicians as they attempt to gain hospital credentials. The former may have its downside to clinical care, but the latter may result in better care, although its misapplication would be most unfortunate. The Vascular Societies have been very direct at suggesting guidelines for hospital privileges that are not related to Board certification.These are not new issues, but they must be addressed. It may not be my place, but I personally believe that the ABS should seriously consider changing the manner with which it appoints its Directors, such that they are elected so as to more likely represent the specific specialty components of surgery rather than various popular leaders of established academic and clinical societies. It would also be my personal advice that they consider a different manner of managing training and certification issues related to surgical oncology, hepatobiliary and gastrointestinal surgery, critical care and trauma, transplantation, and endocrine surgery. These subspecialties should have a venue that provides them with greater responsibility and, most importantly, the authority to define how surgeons are trained and certified in their special areas of practice. Like certain of my predecessors, I strongly believe that vascular surgery should continue to be a part of the training of general surgeons.However, I do not believe that vascular surgery should continue as a primary component of this training. Furthermore, because of practice issues related to better patient care, the vascular surgery community should be respected for having evolved to the point where a greater degree of independence as a Conjoint Board deserves support.Your leadership has met with many individuals and organizations during the past 9 months and has concluded this year with three commitments. First, we believe that the Curriculum Committee and Conjoint Data Committee, developed by us in recent discussions with the ABS and others, should continue their work, with a definitive report from them expected by the October 1997 Joint Council Meeting of your Societies. Second, we will defer until February 1998 submission of our application to the Liaison Committee for Specialty Boards to become an ABMS Board. The completed application will remain unpublicized in our hands, but there is a time frame. Third and last, we will request support for a Conjoint Board from our colleagues on the ABS and ABTS. The logic in creating a Conjoint Board is solid, and benefits would be derived by both of the latter organizations in supporting the vascular surgery community in this action. Closure on this effort will likely be measured in years, not weeks or months. We have the support of many nonsurgeons in the ABMS to pursue Board status. We need the support of many of our surgical colleagues. We are not elitists, and we are not combatants. In fact, we are a lot like everyone else\u2014we care about the discipline of surgery and our patients. Vascular Surgery is no longer in its adolescence. It is a mature specialty with major obligations to society. We must not fail in meeting these obligations.",
  "1998": "Every year, the Society for Vascular Surgery bestows a singular honor on one of its members, its Presidency. Fifty-one of my predecessors have expressed their gratitude for this in various ways, but I'm sure all felt as I do: that to be elected to this office by one's peers is indeed a supreme recognition. And for me, it resulted in one of life's very high moments. I know no other way to convey this than to sincerely say, thank you; thank you for this honor, privilege, and opportunity to have served you.The title of this address reflects my acute awareness that we are in a time of great transition. \u201cLegend, leadership, legacy\u201d is translatable to the past, the present, and the future, but with specific implications.First, we must not, in this chaotic time of change, forget that we are the custodians of the welfare of our patients, who are afflicted with the devastating illness of vascular disease. Second, we must not succumb to the tremendous pressures to change until and unless we really know that it is the right thing to do.All this is in the presence of enormous external forces largely out of our control. Our work is being devalued, our creativity is being strangled, our finances are being eroded, and our turf is under attack. Our very lives are being forced to change in an era in which everything is happening much too fast, and there is no time for reflection.But reflect we must. We must take a deep breath and consider where we've been, where we are, and where we are going. Legend, leadership, and legacy\u2014we must draw on these concepts to develop a steady and correct course. Thus, this address will be historical, philosophical, rhetorical, and, lastly, somewhat personal.Legend is the record of the past, what worked, and who did it. The results are the major contributions to our field. Legacy is what happens if what is done turns out to be the right thing, thereby resulting in future success. Leadership is what is needed to make the right decisions to achieve that success. Leaders must possess a blend of skills, including boldness, wisdom, and judgment. Leadership is the linkage of the past to the future\u2014from the legend to the legacy. It is this linkage that is crucial to the preservation and nurturing of our collective creativity and identity\u2014issues to which I will return later.As an example of legend, I have chosen a person whose contributions began 100 years ago, continued through the 1930s, and took 20 to 30 more years for their full impact to be realized, Alexis Carrel (Figs. 1).Through a detailed review of the life, the work, and the creativity of Carrel, I hope you will gain insight on the legend-to-legacy issue.Alexis Carrel was born outside Lyons, France, in 1873 and died in Paris in 1944. No previous president spent much time on Carrel, and I always wondered why. It was not until 1974 that a biography of him was written in English, by Sterling Edwards. Edwards must also have wondered why no one had spent much time on Carrel. With this excellent book, I started my research. Carrel was a creative genius, with all the assets and all the faults. He was the first scientist working in North America to win a Nobel Prize in physiology and medicine, in 1912 for the work about which we all know. But that work is just an instant in the life of a rather extraordinary person.I first became aware of Carrel when I was in the Navy at the Naval Medical Research Institute's Tissue Bank, and Carrel's work on organ culture was being reproduced and extended there with the consultation of Charles Lindbergh, who had worked with Carrel 30 years before. The general, as he was called, used to come every several months, and from him I learned of Carrel, Carrel's creative genius, and something about the creative process itself. I don't know why, but almost immediately after I realized I had to write this address, I knew Carrel would be part of it.Carrel was an experimental surgeon and never practiced clinical surgery, although he had taken clinical training in Lyons. He became interested in the problems of vascular anastomosis in 1894, after the president of France died in Lyons of hemorrhage from a lacerating stab wound of the portal vein, which the surgeons did not know how to repair.As an intern in 1896, Carrel began the anastomosis work for which he gained considerable public notoriety, even at that early stage. He failed the final examination for staff appointment, called \u201cthe course,\u201d for the first time in 1901 and then again in 1902. It was made clear to him that he was never going to pass \u201cthe course,\u201d so, frustrated, he chose to emigrate to North America in 1904. He thought he would become a rancher.Fate rescued Carrel, however, when Karl Beck invited him to Chicago, where Carrel continued his vascular surgery research in collaboration with Charles Guthrie at the University of Chicago. He was only there for about 2 years, but they were very productive years. He perfected end-to-end and then end-to-side anastomosis for arteries, using running sutures with the triangulation technique. Fine needles, fine sutures of silk coated with petrolatum to minimize vascular wall injury (remember waxing multifilament sutures?), a \u201cno touch\u201d technique, and impeccable asepsis were all part of the successful formula. From these, he moved to veno-arterial anastomoses, then to venous interposition grafts, and then to vein patches to widen primary closure. The Carrel button was the prelude to organ transplantation, and he achieved both autografts and allografts of thyroid, kidney, heart, and even limbs. All these achievements received great notoriety in the lay press. Some have said that it was Guthrie who should have gotten the credit. This is mistaken, as the subsequent careers of both Guthrie and Carrel have amply demonstrated. This was Carrel's work, which began in France and earned him the Nobel Prize in 1912, having been nominated by Karl Beck.The rest of Carrel's career was spent at the newly endowed Rockefeller Institute for Medical Research in New York, where he became one of the first fellows in 1906. His recruitment there followed a most remarkable lecture, given at Johns Hopkins, that summarized his scientific accomplishments to that point. At the Rockefeller Institute, his research interests began to follow a very logical sequence\u2014a process seen in many great creative geniuses. From his early work, he progressed to cell culture, and he became one of the founders of that field. Space does not permit a detailed examination of that work and its immense general importance to the tissue culture field. However, beginning in 1908, he perfected the methods of studying warm-blooded mammalian cells in culture to study wound healing, diseases such as cancer, and tissue preservation for later transplantation. Some cells from a well-publicized experiment on a chick heart were kept in continuous culture for 30 years\u2014probably helped along with cell \u201crefreshment\u201d by zealous assistants, but, nevertheless, a real accomplishment.From cell culture, he moved to organ culture, and it was the organ culture work that resulted in his collaboration with Lindbergh. In 1930, Lindbergh sought out Carrel to develop a method to stop and repair the heart, because Lindbergh's sister-in-law had rheumatic heart disease. The Carrel-Lindbergh perfusion apparatus was developed to be an artificial heart, but it was used in the study of perfused thyroid and hearts with successful preservation up to 3 weeks and in studies of organ function.Carrel's research productivity essentially ended in 1938 with the publication of a book,The Culture of Organs, coauthored with Charles Lindbergh. However, Carrel's creativity is inspiring in its progression from the elemental anastomosis work to tissue culture, to organ culture, and then to the final step. One only needs to review his rich bibliography to see where his work was going\u2014to studies of humankind itself. That comes later, but the associated contributions along the way are enormous.Carrel's anastomotic work led to the first blood transfusion in New York City. The baby of a prominent surgeon with melena neonatorum was treated by Carrel, who anastomosed the father's radial artery to the baby's popliteal vein. All this was done on the dining room table. This took place before blood typing, but fortunately the 2 matched. The baby and the father's hand both survived.The tissue culture work with its demands for asepsis led to the treatment of wounds in World War I with the Carrel-Dakin method, using Dakin's solution, which is still in occasional use today. During the war, Carrel established a hospital in France dedicated to the research and treatment of war wounds, and later he developed training methods for military surgeons in a demonstration hospital back at the Rockefeller Institute.He also explored the possibilities of blood substitutes, the importance of maintaining normal body temperature during surgery, hypothermia for ischemic organ protection during surgical procedures, and endotracheal respiratory support for thoracic procedures.The organ culture work was a prelude to extracorporeal circulation, decades before it became a reality. And Carrel's notable work on the preservation of tissue led to the era of arterial homografts and venous autografts for arterial reconstruction.Despite his strenuous objections, Carrel was forced to retire from the Rockefeller Institute at the age of 65 in 1939, a politically motivated move that left him bitter. What particularly hurt him was that his Department of Experimental Surgery was closed. Carrel had become quite unpopular because of his perceived arrogance and aloofness. Part of this was a problem with language. Although he wrote in English beautifully, he never perfected the spoken word. Furthermore, his failure to become an American citizen, despite his having received so much financial and other support in America, rankled his superiors. In 1935, Carrel wrote a book for the lay readership titledMan the Unknown, which reflected his views, as a scientist, on life and the future of humankind. It became a best seller. It is easy to see, even from the table of contents, where he was going (Figs. 2).This path was to be his ultimate undoing.After his retirement in 1939, Carrel returned to France. While working onMan the Unknown, he got the idea that his final work should be in the creation of an institute where all the problems of humankind could be scientifically and intellectually pursued and maybe solved. Unsuccessful in America, he was able to establish this institute, the Institute for the Study of Human Problems, in France in 1941. This was to be the culmination of his life's work, all headed to the betterment of humankind. It started out all right, but immediately ran into political trouble. By then, Carrel was having heart problems, and he died at age 71 in 1944. His institute was closed soon thereafter. Today Carrel's place in history in France is still quite controversial, and his memory in the United States has largely shrunk to the contributions related to vascular anastomoses.Fifty years after his death, this man who achieved so much seems so under recognized. Why? One reason I focused on Alexis Carrel in this address is that I believe his significant legacy to vascular surgery deserves a more complete chronicle in the archives of the Society for Vascular Surgery. Another reason is that I wanted to use Carrel as a success/failure example in the legend-to-legacy assimilation.There is no question about Carrel's legend. And there is no question he left an important legacy. Why isn't this legacy more apparent? At the risk of being posthumously critical, I say that Carrel failed himself and humankind by making some unfortunate leadership decisions, in both boldness and judgment. This is personal speculation, but I believe Carrel's leadership failure caused his legacy to fall short. This was the fault of genius, perhaps, but true anyway. I have selected two examples from a number of examples that support my view, one early in his life and one at the end.I mentioned he never passed \u201cthe course,\u201d or the examination for a staff position in Lyons and, hence, emigrated to the United States. One reason for this is that, after a visit to the Shrine at Lourdes in 1903, he was led to believe he would never pass. Lourdes is the place where miracles happen, and he observed one. The story is beautifully told in a fictional, but thinly disguised autobiographical, work written by Carrel and published after his death,A Voyage to Lourdes. It is wonderful reading. In it, Louis Lerrac (Carrel spelled backwards) is a substitute physician for a pilgrimage to Lourdes. On the way, he encounters a young woman seemingly near death from what Carrel and others were quite sure was tuberculous peritonitis. Carrel observes that within hours after topical application of the water from the grotto, the woman miraculously begins to improve and ultimately recovers. She survived until 1938, when she died of natural causes. Was this a miracle or not? Carrel was almost convinced, but not quite. This baffled Carrel as a scientist and intrigued him as a mystic, but he couldn't reconcile it. His mysticism is out of the scope of this address, but his decision isn't. He hedged. His scientific work had already gained him considerable notoriety, so he spoke of it to the press. He wouldn't totally acclaim it as a miracle, and this made the church unhappy. He wouldn't declaim it as a mere hysterical conversion, so the medical establishment was also unhappy. This led to his ostracism. This was leadership failure as evidenced by lack of decisiveness or boldness and by lack of judgment by not just remaining silent in indecision. The result was his emigration, but fortunately, his career progressed.It was different at the end of his life. All his scientific work was leading in one seemingly logical direction: the betterment of humankind or, from the French, the perfectibility of humankind; from tissue culture, to organ culture, to human culture or eugenics. This was not a great choice in France in 1941. This is what the Institute of Man was about\u2014or so it was interpreted. That's why the free French or Vichy government financially supported it, and that's why the Nazi German regime allowed it in occupied France in Paris. His close friendship with Lindbergh, who was widely regarded to have German sympathies, also didn't help. This led to the accusation and belief that Carrel was a Nazi collaborator. The historic record shows that this is probably not true, but it killed Carrel's efforts, probably helped kill him, and insidiously diminished his reputation and, thereby, his real legacy.So, what has this got to do with today? Actually, a great deal. With an understanding of legend, both people and events, and with an understanding of legacy and the reasons for it, we can more carefully consider the process of creating it. And that is leadership.Leadership has a broader scope now, but it still comes down to individuals taking the responsibility of making decisions of importance to themselves and others. If the leadership fails, the legend may persist, but the legacy is diminished. This is what happened to Alexis Carrel.The point, and the real message of this address, is our legacy\u2014what we do today that will define our future. Certainly, we do have future legends in our field; many are in this room. History will be the judge of that.However, in these troubled times, we need an intense focus on creating our legacy. And for this, we need lots of leadership, and we need it now. Boldness and judgment, somewhat lacking in my selection for legend, are both needed to face today's issues. Of the many issues, I will focus on two: creativity and identity.We need leadership to better cultivate, stimulate, and support the creative process in vascular surgeons. Our young surgeons, in particular, are being stifled by economic and other pressures, driving them toward practical and easily identifiable productivity and away from fundamental creativity. This is greatly related to finance and financial support. One might argue that there is plenty of innovation going on. Certainly, endoluminal therapies are the stuff of Carrel's genius. However, this is mainly industry-based product development and not what I'm talking about.Basic research productivity is good, but needs substantial nurturing in the environment of shrinking research support. Too much research funding is directed to PhDs who do research full time, and not enough funding is directed to surgeon scientists who not only understand the clinical problems needing research, but also how to research them\u2014bedside to bench and back again. Our superb creation, the Lifeline Foundation, is a great step forward, but only a scant 14% of our membership support it financially. How are we possibly going to be able to convince others to support it at this rate? Moreover, please think about this: Without the philanthropic support of Rockefeller to the institute that bears his name, Carrel's work may never have progressed.However, there's more to this than money. We must find ways to depressurize the academic surgery atmosphere and reward creativity that doesn't earn money, thereby allowing the creative spirit of our young and not-so-young surgeon investigators to prosper and their creative sap to flow. Research is vital to our legacy, because it stimulates both investigator and noninvestigator, resulting in an aura of inquisitiveness and motivation to search for better ways to do things. Without research, vascular surgery is in danger of becoming an intellectual desert, leaving us as mere technicians. Leadership today can and must keep us from that arid legacy.Another great challenge needing leadership is in the area of identity, the definition of our specialty for the near and longer-term future. This will be the essence of the legacy of today's leadership. In the midst of this period of turbulent transition, I believe that we have an identity problem. We think we know who we are, but do we really? Others most certainly don't.Our relationship with the American Board of Surgery (ABS) is a very good example of this and why it is so important for us to get this settled correctly now. This issue is not about board certification per se, but about certification clarifying our identity.The problem is this: Vascular surgeons currently do not have the necessary authority within the ABS to shape the nature of our field\u2014our identity, if you will. In spite of continuing and sincere efforts, we weren't making much progress with the ABS, which until now has considered us as general surgeons with some added exposure and experience with vascular problems. In their view, because vascular surgery is a primary component of general surgery training, anyone finishing a 5-year general surgery residency is qualified to do vascular surgery. Maybe this was true once, but it's preposterous now. Anyone starting a practice today and intending to do a significant amount of vascular surgery should have taken the specialized training and received certification that they have successfully completed it. So what's the big deal? We've had certification for 15 years. The problem has been that what defines being qualified for certification has not generally been under the authority of recognizable vascular surgeons. This is not to demean our earlier and current representatives to the ABS. They merely were not given the tools to conduct the business of vascular surgery, and that's what needs to change.In fact, vascular surgery qualifies in every way to be a primary independent board. And so, in frustration, we formed our own board, the American Board of Vascular Surgery, in 1996. However, the authority to issue certificates must be gained from the American Board of Medical Specialists, and that is not a quick or straightforward process. Nor is there guaranteed success. In the meantime, in 1996, we also identified what the ABS would need to do for us to get the job done with them. Not wishing to see further fragmentation of surgery unless absolutely necessary, all agreed that a satisfactory solution within the ABS would be preferable, thereby keeping surgery whole. We have other pressing, nonsurgeon-related problems with which we need to contend. Because the ABS has never been particularly receptive to change, no one thought they could or would change enough to allow this to happen. But, in fact, the ABS did respond with substantial change in recognition of current realities.In January 1998, the ABS voted to create a subspecialty board in vascular surgery under their aegis and invited us to join in this effort. The ABS Sub-Board for Vascular Surgery is to be made up of vascular surgeons we will select. Authority for the doing of the business of vascular surgery is to be delegated to our sub-board.Despite this, we're not sure whether the ABS really will do what it recently has promised. And even if they do, will it be enough? I don't know, but it is my personal conviction that the only way we will ever find out is to try it. Considerable skepticism exists as to whether the ABS can really \u201cgive\u201d enough to make this work. I share that skepticism, but I also believe we need to try this now. We ultimately will have to make the first step based on good faith, which is a bold leadership step. And what's the downside? Only time. If it works out, we have established an important legacy regarding our future identity. If it doesn't, we still will have clarified our identity. If we fail in a genuine effort to make things work within the ABS, we are in a vastly strengthened position to proceed to full independence. Where leadership is needed is in the exercising of sufficient wisdom and judgment to recognize whether these goals are achieved. But, it would also be leadership failure if we were not to try this new relationship.A broader identity issue involves the recognition that others would usurp what we do and, in so doing, trivialize nearly 100 years worth of experience beginning with, among others, the work of Carrel. But this is a challenge to more than just surgical technique or research; it challenges our role in the care of patients with vascular disease. The identity crisis comes from the rapid emergence of less-invasive technologies for vascular problems and the progression of these technologies, which has happened so fast that most vascular surgeons don't yet possess sufficient skills to do them. The bigger problem is that others, interventional radiologists and cardiologists, do possess sufficient skills. These technologies are based on fluoroscopy, guide wires, balloons, stents, and the like, and most surgeons have had scant experience, during training or since, with these approaches and techniques. Let us consider the problem: What do you suppose is going to happen as soon as endoluminal prosthetic devices are \u201cminiaturized\u201d enough for percutaneous placement?So, what do we do about this? First, we should remember and then turn to our real strength to deal with the situation. This strength is our full understanding of the problems of our patients, their natural history, their interventions, and the results of what is done for them. This is what we know best, the right thing to do for a particular patient and when.Most of us treat patients with mild-to-moderate problems expectantly. We resist intervening just because the lesion is there. With growing frequency, this is not the case with others. For example, incidental renal artery angioplasty for asymptomatic stenosis is being performed increasingly by cardiologists during procedures on the coronary arteries. I deplore these actions, because cardiologists don't really understand the consequences of their questionable initial treatment success. This does not mean that this treatment strategy is globally wrong. It does mean that this technology, as all new ones, needs to be addressed carefully and studiously by those who understand the problems in perspective\u2014those who already have a demonstrated responsibility for intervention and a compulsion about learning the short- and long-term outcomes. This is the definition of the vascular surgeon.In contrast, endoluminal therapy for aortic aneurysm is largely being evaluated by innovative vascular surgeons. This is the right way, but if we don't sustain leadership over the evolution of all such technology, all will suffer, in particular, our patients. I said earlier that we are the guardians of our patients' welfare. We must maintain this responsibility. If we fail this, we have failed in leadership, and our legacy is dark. It is from this base that we should proceed. So, what are the options? I offer 3. First, we can do nothing. Let matters unfold as they will. This is fundamentally unsound, because our basis of practice will be eroded by others who don't understand the diseases we treat as well as we do. Leadership boldness and leadership judgment, both required in today's instance, say that doing nothing is simply not an option.Second, we can form alliances with radiology, cardiology, or both. In the past year, council representatives have met with both groups. Vascular radiologists already have developed and demonstrated considerable skill in the less invasive therapies of vascular lesions. Radiologists are also very concerned about the future of their field. The discussions with radiology are more advanced, because liaison there has considerable logic. Cardiologists, in contrast, seem less concerned, and some have declared that peripheral arterial interventions are a part of cardiology and, therefore, part of their turf. The problem here is real. So, there is considerable impetus to form \u201calliances\u201d with both groups, for differing reasons, to avoid very destructive \u201cturf\u201d wars. Joint ventures in the form of centers exist today. A \u201chybrid\u201d vascular interventionalist has been proposed, but how are we going to do that? Can you envision a nonsurgeon operating on someone now or anytime soon? On the other hand, can you envision a vascular surgeon doing all catheter-based interventions? I can. Actually, there are some sitting in the audience who already do this. To me, it is quite clear which way the technology/skill transfer needs to go, but it won't go there unless we make it happen.The third option is just do it. Vascular radiologists have not been willing to teach vascular surgeons or our trainees catheter-based skills, but we are learning them anyway. With some careful but forceful leadership decisions, vascular surgeons in training will become competent in these skills, thereby ensuring that in the near future there may not be a problem. However, in the meantime, we have a large under served group in the middle\u2014most of this audience. We must develop training and educational opportunities for anyone interested in acquiring these skills now. This will be tough to do. We have a good start in several venues, including that offered by the Joint Vascular Societies. But this is only a start; we must do more.I think we must approach this issue boldly and broadly. As we train the residents and fellows to perform these innovative procedures, we must encourage them to do something heretofore difficult: reverse the process. The young must teach the old. For this to happen, the barriers, some practical, some economic, and certainly some traditional, need to be addressed. We should continue to explore working arrangements with those in other fields whom we know would usurp our identity, but see if we can somehow enfold them within us. If so, fine, but we can't just keep talking with them indefinitely. If we can't, we must continue as we have in the past and just do it. Learn it, do it, and teach it.The lessons of history, observations of the present, and goals for the future are an important amalgamation from which I hope we can gain insight about how to proceed. Two years ago, our 50th president, Frank Veith, likened the evolution of vascular surgery to the observations of Charles Darwin on the evolution of the species. It is true that we are evolving, but we must be aggressively proactive in what is now very rapid evolution. In Darwin's terms, we have to be the fittest if we are to survive. Legend, leadership, legacy. We know the past, and we have the leadership. Now we need to create our legacy. Carpe diem.",
  "1999": "I am thankful for the great honor and privilege you have bestowed on me in allowing me to serve as your President during the past year. It is particularly humbling to be standing before you, my professional peers, at this unique moment in time\u2014June 7, 1999. There are 207 days, 12 hours, and 27 minutes left in this millennium, and the clock is ticking. As time runs out on this millennium, it seems appropriate to reflect on the issue of time and to review the past, take stock of the present, and think about the future and the future of vascular surgery. But first, I would like to reflect on what is most important in my own past, present, and future, and that is my family, my heritage, and my profession.My family came to this country 54 years ago as refugees of World War II. I grew up in the parish house of the Latvian church in Brooklyn, NY, where my father to this day continues his commitment to his profession, the ministry, and devotes himself to the needs of the members of his congregation.As has been the case for millions of other refugees from around the world, the terrible misfortune of war and devastation also provided an incredible opportunity in America. I am grateful for my good fortune to have grown up in America and am mindful of my even greater fortune of the love and support of a wonderful family. Please permit me to pause for a moment here to thank my family: my parents, who brought me to this country and selflessly supported my growth and education; my wonderful, loving wife, Zinta, who has stood by my side, unfailingly supporting my professional career while nurturing our family in two cultures, Latvian and American; and my three wonderful children, Daina, Sascha, and Karina, all of whom speak fluent Latvian. There are no adequate words to thank you, at least not in English. Mils, mils paldies.I would also like to thank my mentors: Dr William Fry, who set for me the standard of clinical excellence\u2014surgical precision and patient care above all else; Dr David Skinner, who set for me the standard for academic excellence\u2014combining research, teaching, and patient care into the everyday life of an academic surgeon; and Dr Seymour Glagov, who set for me the standard for basic investigation\u2014the understanding of the fundamental biologic and pathologic processes of vascular disease. I am grateful for the support and inspiration of my superb colleagues on the faculties of the University of Chicago and Stanford University and for the creativity, energy, and commitment of the students, residents, and vascular surgery fellows with whom I have worked. They are the real future of vascular surgery.Meanwhile, in Latvia, the Soviet occupation would last 50 years. Many of those in my family who were not killed by the Communists were deported to Siberia. Their opportunities were quite different from mine. This became a stark reality for me when I first visited Latvia in 1986, then still an occupied country under Soviet rule. For the first time, I met my relatives\u2014my first cousins, who were my age, and their children, who were my children's ages. We saw how different our lives were as a result of fate and government systems. We sometimes take for granted the incredible freedom and opportunities we enjoy in America. We must guard and protect our individual freedom against ever-increasing governmental regulation and control. I am filled with a great sense of gratitude for this great land of opportunity that is now my home, the United States, and a desire to give something back to my native country, Latvia, and to those less fortunate than I.We have in our audience today five vascular surgeons from Latvia. Their situation in Latvia is a far cry from what we enjoy in the United States. Doctors in Latvia do not enjoy the wealth, status, and power that we do. They work in antiquated hospitals with inadequate resources and supplies. They receive meager salaries, and most of them must have second jobs to pay the bills. Despite this sad state of affairs, these are professional, dedicated, capable physicians. They work hard and provide good medical care. They did not go into medicine for the money. They are in it for the reasons we all went into medicine in the first place\u2014to take care of the sick. Perhaps we can gain some perspective from our Latvian colleagues as we consider the issues that face us today.Despite having the best healthcare system in the world with the knowledge, resources, technology, and capability to cure disease like never before, we are surrounded by a sense of doom and gloom. Doctors are frustrated and unhappy, patients are frustrated and unhappy, and the healthcare system is in turmoil, not because of factors within medicine but because of external economic forces that are threatening medicine. The managed care revolution, with its inherent focus on cost cutting and profit seeking, has dramatically altered the way medicine is practiced in America. The medical profession is under siege. It seems as though the healthcare of our nation, which society always had entrusted to medical professionals, has now been placed in the hands of financial people: chief executive officers, chief financial officers, administrators, and business managers.The economic crisis in healthcare has raised many important questions. Will medicine play a major role in determining the health of society in the future? Will patients look to their doctors for advice, or will healthcare analysts and financial planners choose treatment? How can we resolve the conflicts between professionalism and managed care? Will the doctor of the 21st century be a true professional or merely the instrument of an insurance company trying to place barriers before patients and restrict access to care?These are the fundamental questions that we must address in this age of turmoil and rapid change to understand where we are going in the future. And in doing so, it seems to me, we can boil it down to three key issues: time, money, and professionalism. Do we have time to be physicians and surgeons? Will there be enough money for medical care? Will the profession of medicine survive?First, let us consider time. A millennium seems like an eternity. As a child, I remember how time seemed to stand still. Summer vacation lasted forever, and then the school year would never end. But now, each passing year is a smaller and smaller percent of my lifetime. A year passes in a moment. And now time will run out in this millennium.In a review of the past millennium, it is remarkable not only how things have changed but also how rapidly the rate of change has increased, particularly in the last half of the last century of this millennium. In our everyday lives today, we are using technology that we did not even dream was possible just a decade ago. Much of the technology is focused on labor-saving devices that would give us more time: machines, tractors, vacuum cleaners, and dishwashers.Just thirty years ago, the experts were assuring us that, with advances in technology, our biggest challenge would be what to do with all the leisure time we were going to have in the future. But the future is now, and life for most of us has become so complicated, rapid paced, and stressful that the idea of leisure time has become antiquated. We have run out of time. We want more time, but we cannot get it. Time quickly disappears and is gone forever.We need more time. We need time for our patients. We need time for our families. We need time for ourselves and for our everyday lives. We need time for the profession of medicine and for the profession of vascular surgery. The care of patients with vascular disease requires time. As we lose time and get busier and busier, we seem to be enjoying it less and less.In this all-too-fast-paced environment, we must take the time to stop and reflect, to reorganize our priorities. What is really important to us as individuals, family members, physicians, and vascular surgeons? Why did we go into medicine in the first place?It is no accident that the fastest-growing segment of the healthcare market is alternative medicine. Patients seek out chiropractors, herbal and Chinese medicine practitioners, and faith healers of all types because they spend time with patients, provide them with information and hope, and give them a role in their own healthcare decisions. We must be there for our patients. We must provide the time they need if we are to survive as the specialty that provides care for patients with vascular disease.The second critical issue is money. Just as we have run out of time, we also seem to have run out of money. In this era of managed care, health maintenance organizations do not manage care but manage costs. Both nonprofit and for-profit health maintenance organizations compete for patients largely on the basis of price. They focus on the short term by reducing monthly premiums to sign up as many \u201ccovered lives\u201d as possible and balance the equation by rationing care. This is particularly pernicious when physicians are taken out of the decision loop or, worse yet, when physicians are placed in positions of conflict of interest by the use of economic incentives to withhold care. Physician reimbursement patterns provide a disincentive for physicians to spend time with their patients. Whereas we have grown up thinking that \u201ctime is money,\u201d we now find that \u201ctime is no money.\u201dIn most professions, including the legal profession, services are billed on the basis of time spent. This is not the case in medicine. We are being asked to do more and are being paid less. This is particularly true in vascular surgery. Vascular surgery services are time intensive and were undervalued when the relative value unit (RVU) system was introduced in 1992. This is because vascular surgeons were not represented in the Hsaio studies, which set the relative work values. Vascular society efforts to rectify this problem, led by Hugh Trout, were blocked by the Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA) in 1993. The further decline in Medicare reimbursements that was mandated by the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 is now resulting in a crisis for vascular surgery.In September of last year, the Joint Vascular Societies again appealed to HCFA for revision of Medicare payment policies. Drs Zwolak and Oblath presented extensive and convincing data to the Administrator of HCFA, Nancy Min-DeParle, that the medicare fee schedule reductions imposed on vascular surgery were a severe threat to the future of high-quality vascular surgery. They pointed out that the abrupt elimination of the separate surgical conversion factor in 1998 cut 9% from our Medicare payments in a single year. We now face another 12% reduction with resource-based practice expense. Carotid endarterectomy, our most commonly performed operation, is a good example. In 1992, the global RVU was 35.26 with a typical payment of $1200. In 2002, the total RVU will be 31.08. With an adjustment for a 3% annual inflation rate and with the unlikely assumption that the conversion factor will not decrease further, the typical Medicare payment in 2002 will be only $800 in 1992 dollars, according to a letter from R.W. Oblath et al, September 1998. This represents an absolute payment reduction to the surgeon of 33% in a decade when all other medical expenses have increased much faster than 3% inflation and when, during the same period, inflation-adjusted payments for evaluation and management services increased substantially.Our Governmental Relations Committee, headed by Bob Zwolak and his team of Bob Oblath, Hugh Trout, Tony Sidaway, Gary Seabrook, Craig Kent, Denny Baker, and Carlo Dall'Olmo, has made our voice heard in Washington and has made important progress on our behalf. But the obstacles and problems abound, with no real relief in sight.Remember that 70% of our patients are Medicare beneficiaries, so we depend on the medicare fee schedule more than any other specialty. And in Medicare, we now find ourselves in a zero sum game in terms of healthcare economics. There is only a finite sum of money available for Medicare patients. The federal government has mandated no increase in Medicare expenditures. In fact, they will decrease dramatically as a result of the Balanced Budget Act of 1997. Of the $127 billion that is to be saved over 5 years, $116 billion will come from reductions in Medicare.The bottom line is that, to maintain budgetary neutrality as the number of Medicare beneficiaries inevitably increases, the conversion factor must decrease. It is no secret that we will work harder and be paid less.This change will be implemented by a progressive reduction in the RVU reimbursement rate. We will simply be paid less for the same amount of work. At some point, if this trend continues, we will reach a time when it no longer pays to deliver the service. Of course, we cannot NOT take care of the patient. We always have, and we always will. But at some point, one goes out of business and stops practicing altogether. It is not overstating the problem to contend that the reductions in Medicare fees from 1992 to 2002 threaten to eliminate high-quality vascular surgery. We are already at risk of losing our most valuable resources: wise and experienced vascular surgeons with the largest practices. In the last few years, we have seen many of our most skilled colleagues retire early because of frustration over rapidly declining reimbursement. Perhaps even more worrisome is the fact that we may not be able to nurture our \u201cyoung,\u201d our students, residents, and fellows, to become future vascular surgeons because of their fears, which, I might add, are well justified, that after 7 or 8 years of postgraduate training, they may not be able to pay off their medical school debts and earn a reasonable living.Given this bleak picture, one might ask, \u201cWhy would anyone choose to go into vascular surgery?\u201d In fact, I believe there is a real danger that in the future we may find that the brightest and most qualified students and residents will choose fields other than vascular surgery. The long hours required for vascular surgery and inadequate compensation may result in a decreasing number of vascular surgeons and too few specialists capable of direct vascular repair. The future shortage of vascular surgeons may be significantly worse than those numbers projected by Dr Jim Stanley's workforce study.These problems will be compounded by the economic crisis that faces hospitals, particularly the academic health centers. Most major teaching hospitals are now losing money, despite record numbers of patients, operating rooms at capacity, and a demand for services that is greater than ever. Some of the nation's most prestigious academic medical centers report losses as high as $1 million a week.The deficits are prompting massive layoffs of staffand reducing hospital bond ratings.Strategies that involve mergers and acquisitions seem to be failing,and we are beginning to see bankruptcies of major teaching facilities. Many teaching hospitals are threatened.These are the very hospitals that are the major providers of healthcare to the poor and indigent. How will we meet this crying need?Furthermore, will there be funding for graduate medical education? The National Bipartisan Commission on the Future of Medicare disbanded in March of this year. The commission fell one vote short of the 11 needed to achieve the super majority necessary to endorse a proposed set of reforms to Congress and the President. The plan by Commission Chairman Senator John Beaux proposed, among other reforms, to end the entitlement status of the $2.2 billion direct and indirect Medicare financing for graduate medical education. Such a process would shift graduate medical education financing to the annual appropriations process and would threaten the financial stability necessary to support residency programs that last from 3 to 7 years. Senator John D. Rockefeller IV, one of the seven who voted against the plan, warned advocates for teaching hospitals that the Medicare reforms stand a good chance of being passed by the Senate.It seems no one wants to pay for medical education, and the buck is being passed.We therefore need to consider not only will anyone want to go into vascular surgery, but also what will be the teaching environment for future vascular surgeons? This is a critical question for the future of our profession.What else does the future hold? The great philosopher Yogi Berra once stated that \u201cthe future ain't what it used to be.\u201d However, in many ways, the future is dictated by what already has happened. Consider, for example, the influence of birth rates. We can know what will happen in the future simply by knowing how many babies are born each year. Add to this the immigration rate, and you will know what the population of the country will be years into the future.Generation cycles, which have been tracked as far back as the 1400s, occur every 40 years.In the United States, immigration, rather than birth rate, was the driving factor behind growth and generation cycles before the early 1900s. A surge in the birth rate from 1945 to 1965 along with a great increase in immigration created the \u201cbaby boom generation\u201d that we hear so much about. This generation will be four times the size of the previous generation. The members of this generation are now at the peak of their productivity and consumption. This is, to a large extent, what is driving our current and prolonged economic boom.But soon they will reach retirement age, and these baby boomers will become Medicare patients. They will spend less, and the economy will decline. Advances in medicine, public health, and nutrition have increased longevity, and this generation will be the first generation that has not physically toiled for 40 years before retirement. They will be in better shape to have vascular disease. An individual born in 1997 can expect to live to 76.5 years, about 29 years longer than a person born in 1900.Thus, there is no question that the number of elderly people and the number of patients with vascular disease will increase markedly in the next millennium. One hundred years ago, only three million Americans were more than the age of 65 years. Today, 33 million Americans live beyond that age. By the year 2040, the number of individuals in the United States who are more than the age of 50 years is expected to double, jumping from 70 million to 140 million.Today, there are roughly 38 million Medicare beneficiaries, but by 2030, when the last of the baby boomers will be 65 years old, there will be 76 million Medicare beneficiaries. The demand for vascular care will be unprecedented. We must begin thinking about how we will meet this demand. Again, will we have enough vascular surgeons, and how will we pay for patient care?If we do not address and solve these problems, the losers will be the patients with vascular disease. And from a societal standpoint, that is a major concern\u2014the prospect of not having qualified practitioners to perform sophisticated, high-intensity vascular surgery in the future. A decline in the quality of vascular care will cause significant increases in costs to the healthcare system. Will there be a significant decrease in the quality of care? Will we see more strokes, amputations, and ruptured aneurysms? Will we see the day when major treatment decisions are made on the basis of reimbursement patterns?Today, for example, a radiologist would be paid more for venography and placement of an inferior vena cava (IVC) filter than we would be paid for a femoral-distal bypass grafting procedure that would take 4 to 6 hours. Percutaneous catheter-directed thrombolysis, angioplasty, and stenting pay about the same as a ruptured aneurysm repair. Moreover, we care for that patient for 90 days with in-hospital care, intensive care unit care, and postoperative care, and perhaps weekly follow-up visits in the clinic if wound care is required, all for the same global fee. However, the percutaneous interventional procedure can be repeated the next day and the day after and full payment will be received for each procedure. It would be a tragedy if the ultimate solution were to apply therapies because of how they are reimbursed and to abandon those therapies that either are not reimbursed or are reimbursed inadequately. The reimbursement schedules should be fair and should reflect the time and effort expended lest unintended consequences occur that are not to the benefit of the patient.What can we do to address these issues? First, we must bring public awareness to the problem. Individual patients and doctors are already aware that there is a problem. But this must become an issue for Congress and for the President. In the future, the most potent political force in our country will be senior citizens, not only because they are so large in number, but also because they are the one demographic group that consistently goes to the polls and votes. Thus, the concerns of the senior citizens will be heard and addressed. We must support our social and legislative issues committee and educate our citizens on the importance of vascular disease therapy. We must work together with our interventional colleagues to ensure that a coding and reimbursement system is in place that will properly pay for services rendered and effort expended regardless of specialty. We all must become involved and begin to address the issues of supply and demand before the supply of vascular surgeons runs out and the demands of our senior citizens cannot be met. We must protect our research and teaching environments and stimulate our students, our residents, and our fellows by being role models in the profession of vascular surgery.But all is not doom and gloom. I, for one, believe that the problems will be addressed and solved\u2014they always are. Worsening problems will force change. The aging population in future elections will demand it, and science and technology will come to the rescue with new and more effective treatment strategies. Science and technology have always led the way.The remarkable advances in genomics and molecular biology and pharmacology will transform the practice of medicine. The changes that we have witnessed during the past few years in the rapidly changing technology of the treatment of aortic aneurysms, carotid artery disease, and peripheral occlusive disease have made it clear that vascular surgery will never be the same. Will we grow and adapt, accommodating and embracing the technology and changes, or will we let the world pass us by?We are on the cusp of a paradigm shift in vascular care, which will be spurred by enormous increases in demand. The decline in reimbursement for time-intensive open surgery threatens this mode of therapy, but it will not disappear, and it will continue to play a role in vascular surgery.New technology, new imaging capabilities, and web-based communication will revolutionize the way people seek and find their doctors, the way we practice and administer treatment to vascular patients, and the way we are compensated. New technology has already revolutionized the way we visualize blood vessels and envision the treatment of vascular disease. Diagnostic methods will be noninvasive, with complete three-dimensional imaging of the vasculature that will soon replace diagnostic angiography. We will be able to plan and execute treatments in virtual reality and test their effectiveness before instituting treatment.Catheter-based treatments will largely replace open surgical procedures, and vascular surgical care will dramatically change.Perhaps a large part of what we do will be outpatient based. Outmoded methods of treatment will be abandoned, not necessarily because they are ineffective or risky, but because the patient will demand the newer noninvasive methods. Witness the growth of carotid stenting when a proven, effective surgical therapy is available.However, although new techniques and technology are critical to the future of vascular surgery, we must remember that technology is merely a tool. The more complex and sophisticated treatment options become and the more information and choices become available to patients on the Internet, the more people will need the wise counsel of a knowledgeable doctor. They will have information overload and will not know where to turn. There will also be an enormous segment of society that will be left behind in the information age. The knowledge gap will widen enormously.Patients will more and more need the advice and comfort of a caring physician. And yet, patients more and more are increasingly believing that they have no doctor. Many perceive that the principal focus of medicine is moving away from its focus on caring. Patients feel shortchanged by the hurried pace and brevity of their encounters with doctors. They want their doctor back.This brings me to the third and most important subject: professionalism. You may recall that when the Clinton administration began its effort to reform healthcare in this country, it convened a secretive panel led by Ira Magaziner. Notable was the fact that this panel, which would set the course and direction of the nation's healthcare for the future, excluded doctors and physician organizations. We heard such things as \u201cif we could control Medicare fraud and abuse there was enough money to pay for the care of the nation's uninsured.\u201d Although the Clinton health plan failed, the legacy of excluding and distrusting doctors persists. The government has launched a crackdown on Medicare fraud and abuse, contending that simply the submission of an inaccurate bill may constitute fraud. We are guilty until proven innocent, and the government is enlisting our elderly patients as \u201cwhistle blowers,\u201d with bounty payment rewards to detect allegedly fraudulent bills.Does this represent mistrust only by our government, or do our patients no longer trust us? Does the public no longer trust doctors? Is the medical profession no longer entrusted with responsibility for the nation's health?Professionalism is a commitment to subordinate one's self interest to the interest of one's patients. This constitutes the very foundation of trust on which our social contract rests. Maintaining the mutual trust in the doctor-patient relationship is the only way to assure the public that medicine is fulfilling its sacred obligation. No patient's bill of rights, no laws, no review panels or regulations, no whistle blowers or watchdog federal agencies can substitute for the fundamental TRUST and CARING that are central to the profession of medicine.There are several features that characterize professionalism: (1) altruism and a commitment to a greater good; (2) a high degree of knowledge, special education, and training; (3) the ability and willingness to apply that knowledge and skill to a greater societal good; (4) autonomy and the right to self regulate and society's implicit trust in that self regulation; and (5) conformance to and development of a code of ethics, such as the Hippocratic oath.However, the principles of professionalism are in direct conflict with the commercialization of medicine. Ethical challenges exist in reconciling Hippocratic medicine, which is based on the doctor-patient relationship, with population-based healthcare, in which considerations of cost effectiveness and distribution of healthcare resources are focused on achieving the greatest good for the greatest number of people. This puts us in conflict as professionals. Do we care for our individual patient above all else, or do we devote ourselves to healthcare systems that distribute services to people on the basis of population or group outcome measures designed to control costs and improve efficiency? We, as surgeons, have always dealt closely and directly with our individual patient. Will we still have the right to put our patient first, above all else, in the future? Along with the compensation issues I discussed earlier, the managed care revolution is threatening professionalism in several important ways.The first threat is an attack on professional judgment. One of the central characteristics of professionals is that they are empowered and obligated to make judgments that are in the best interests of their patients. Although scientific data and evidence have been critical to the advancement of medicine, the application of evidence-based medicine to treatment algorithms eliminates the professional from the decision-making process. We see this in the current popular notion that new treatments can only be advocated if validated by prospective randomized clinical trials\u2014a process, which by its very nature, eliminates professional judgment. For example, to participate in a prospective randomized clinical trial on carotid stenting, the vascular surgeon must be able to say to his or her patient that \u201cin my best professional judgment, I do not know which form of treatment is best for you, endarterectomy or carotid stenting, and I, therefore, give you the opportunity to participate in a trial where the treatment will be chosen at random.\u201d In other words, \u201cI have no advice or recommendation for you, my patient.\u201d That is not to say that we do not need to do the study or that we do not need to know the outcome of such a randomized trial, but it does pose an ethical dilemma for the doctor's professional judgment and commitment to the best interests of the patient.Evidence-based medicine is statistically oriented and eliminates physician judgment for an individual patient. It is population-based medicine, not individual-based medicine, which is at the core of the doctor-patient relationship. Brought to the extreme, this strategy could eliminate physicians from making therapeutic recommendations and decisions and have technicians apply treatments based strictly on statistically based \u201cevidence.\u201d I believe this would be as detrimental for patients as it obviously would be for the profession.The second attack is on collegial self-regulation. A core value of professionals is that a profession is a self-regulating body of people. The profession sets and regulates training curricula and standards and oversees peer review of practice standards. Surgery has a long tradition of upholding standards through the American College of Surgeons and the American Board of Surgery. As the field of vascular surgery has grown and evolved as its own distinct specialty with its own body of basic fundamental knowledge and unique clinical expertise, the need for it to regulate itself as its own professional discipline has become apparent.Thus evolved the Program Evaluation and Endorsement Committee, the vascular fellowships under Residency Review Committee review, the Association of Program Directors in Vascular Surgery, and the American Board of Vascular Surgery. The importance to the vascular surgery profession of board regulation of training standards by vascular surgeons has been emphasized by Dr Stanley in his Presidential address to this Society.The creation of a sub-board for vascular surgery under the umbrella of the American Board of Surgery is evidence of the evolution of vascular surgery as its own profession, which requires peer self-regulation. The early work of the sub-board has been promising, and we must work to develop it as the mechanism by which we, as vascular surgeons, exercise our obligation to self regulate our profession. This is the standard by which the success of the sub-board should be judged. It is encouraging that professional groups, rather than splitting apart, now are beginning to join together to challenge the attack on the overall profession by the managed-care economy and regulatory changes occurring in our society. We must maintain our right to self regulate to maintain our profession.Although professionals receive remuneration for what they do, this is not our primary motivation. What really motivates physicians is membership in one's professional society of peers. Peers set the standards. Peer review and acceptance and a focus on peer professional activities are central to our lives. Witness the importance we attach to membership in the Society for Vascular Surgery and the International Society for Cardiovascular Surgery. If our peers do not accept us, we are outcasts. Each hospital has its own peer review mechanism, both formal and informal. We evaluate ourselves and our peers on an individual basis, just as we treat our patients on an individual basis. We monitor our own results, and, as Norman Hertzer correctly concluded in his Presidential address, \u201cresults are everything\u201d in vascular surgery.We must demonstrate our outcomes and results to our patients, our referring doctors, to the payers, and to the public.However, the current enthusiasm for outcome analysis with large-sample, computer-generated analysis of large data banks again risks missing the boat of individual result assessment. Managed-care advocates are purely financially driven in studying outcome analysis. Excessive zeal in evaluating outcomes without reliable risk stratification (and I have not yet seen a reliable way to do this, given the complexity of patients) runs the risk of focusing healthcare on patients with good risk and denying care to the patients at high risk and to those who are most infirm.The third element under attack is professional development and education. Adequate training and the instillation of the essential ingredients and characteristics of a profession require a professional community that is alive and well. Medicine is not carrying out a technical exercise but living a professional existence. There is a process of initiation into the profession through our educational and training programs, including internship, residency, and fellowship. These long and arduous years of training instill core values and judgment through mentorship and professional role models. We must preserve and protect our teaching environments.Cooperation among different specialties is also important in the current economic climate. Although turf battles may have been popular in years past, it is now increasingly clear that we must work together to preserve the right to deliver the highest quality care to our patients. Gone is the idea that \u201cwe will not teach you this or that technique in the hope that we can keep it for ourselves.\u201d Such logic never had merit, for technology and techniques are simply techniques. Technology cannot be owned by a specialty. Techniques do not comprise a discipline or specialty\u2014they are simply tools. Different specialties may use new tools and technologies in different ways, which are appropriate for their patients and practices. We must begin by integrating educational activities to improve communication. Each of our multiple vascular specialties brings a different and complementary perspective on the same fundamental problem: vascular disease. We can, and we do, learn from each other, for vascular disease is one that requires a long-term commitment of care for each patient from professionals.There can be no doubt that professionalism in medicine provides an intrinsic value. Professionalism is good for society, good for individuals in society, the patients, and good for the professionals themselves. Society entrusts the health of its members to highly skilled and well-trained individuals who have a moral obligation to promote the health and well being of the members of society.The individual members of society benefit from this professionalism through improved health, a sense of well being, and moral confidence in knowing that the physician is there for them, ostensibly with only one motivation\u2014to provide the best possible medical care.And the professionals themselves benefit. Society provides many rewards to the professional physicians, among them power, status, and wealth. But these are not enough. Internal rewards, such as self esteem, gratitude from patients, professional satisfaction, and companionship and praise from colleagues, are also necessary. These rewards are based on relationships, and they require time to cultivate. The doctor-patient relationship is paramount to professional satisfaction. And frankly, this is what is most threatened by the managed-care revolution.Although management guidelines and evidence-based medicine may be effective for certain populations of well-defined and specified conditions, they are unlikely to be effective for the patients who are the sickest and need a doctor the most. In cases of mortality, complexity, chronicity, and debility, the physician must exercise individualized care and judgment. The doctor-patient relationship is most critical to patients at these times of crisis and uncertainty in their lives. They want and need someone who cares for them and about them. As the population ages, more patients will demand the right to have a long-term relationship with a physician they can trust because there is value in the relationship itself.For the doctor, the doctor-patient relationship is also critical, not only for our personal satisfaction as physicians but also for the future of our specialty. Vascular surgeons were the first to develop effective methods of vascular therapy and reconstruction and noninvasive vascular diagnosis. With these tools, vascular surgery evolved as a specialty focused on the short-term and long-term management of patients with vascular disease. We have an understanding of the natural history of vascular disease and of nonoperative, conservative strategies and the outcomes of direct and indirect treatments. The direct long-term interaction and focus on the patient as a whole is critical in being the vascular doctor. But as technology advances, what remains is the doctor-patient relationship, and the maintainance of this relationship is the future of vascular surgery.The critical question is, who will fill this role? Will vascular surgeons be professionals who provide care to patients with vascular disease? Or will vascular surgeons become technicians who apply therapy while allowing physicians in other specialties to assume responsibility for vascular care? It is my belief that the key to preserving our place as the primary caretaker of patients with vascular disease is preserving the doctor-patient relationship.Now I have some thoughts on the future for the next generation of vascular surgeons.Despite the problems that surround us, now is a good time for vascular surgery. This is a time of great advancement in the field, of breakthrough, fundamental changes in the way we think about and treat vascular disease. The explosion of new knowledge will continue, and you have an opportunity to be at the forefront of this expanding knowledge base. To this extent, you are fortunate to have the active support of the Lifeline Foundation, the National Institutes of Health, and the industry to support your investigations.Seize the opportunity to learn and expand your horizons over and above standard open vascular reconstruction. But do not abandon the basic fundamentals of vascular surgical practice: learn them and practice them well because no one else will have the capability of direct, open reconstruction when needed, the most definitive and powerful treatment.The next 5 to 10 years will be tumultuous, uncertain, and anxiety filled as the healthcare system restructures itself. Do not lose faith. The practice as we know it will change, but the patients' needs will not change. They will be there, and you must be there for them. Keep at the forefront. In addition to vascular reconstruction, there will be gene therapy, catheter-based therapy, new technology, new strategies, strange proposals\u2014some will work, many will not. But always maintain the best interests of the patient foremost.After 10 years, there will be an unprecedented demand for your services. If you have been under compensated up to this point, you will now be paid a premium. The massive increase in patient demand will be accompanied by an inadequate supply of skilled vascular surgeons, particularly those with skills in open surgical repair and reconstruction. General surgeons will no longer have the skills for major aortic surgery. You will be overwhelmed by demand. This demand for your services will continue throughout your career. As demand increases, training programs will be expanded, but given the length of time needed to properly train vascular surgeons, the buildup will be slow. The proper number of surgeons will likely be reached just about the time the number of patients begins to decrease in 2040, and then there will be a surplus of vascular surgeons. Thus, this is the golden era for the next generation of vascular surgery. Enjoy it and make the most of it.My advice:1.Be receptive to new ideas and new strategies.2.Learn endovascular skills, evaluate new technology, and incorporate them into your practice as appropriate while maintaining your surgical skills.3.Generate new knowledge, for knowledge will lead the way.4.Work together with your colleagues in other disciplines to improve the care of patients with vascular disease.5.Preserve and promote professionalism and the sacredness of the doctor/patient relationship.Let me conclude by once again addressing the special elements of time and caring. As we have seen, the current economic climate is to reduce costs and to reduce reimbursements for time and energy expended. There is no compensation for more time spent with a patient. In the case of global billing, extra time means no extra money.Yet time is the indispensable element that cannot be replaced in the doctor-patient relationship. And it is this element of time with the patient that is incompatible with medical care for profit.Time is required for caring. Time is required for professional judgment, and that time varies with the complexity of each case. But the most important element is the interaction and contact with the patient. There must be communication, which is free from the constraint of time, at least for a moment. This is the so-calledtimeless momentof meaning and communication. The most essential quality of the doctor-patient relationship is the doctor's presence with the patient. The gift of healing is the act of being there. There must be that indispensable element of human compassion and science, knowledge, and technology.This human interaction takes time, but not necessarily much time. There are 10 simple rules:1.Take the time to listen. Listen for 1 minute to your patient. The average doctor listens for about 18 seconds before interrupting the patient.2.Make contact. Touch the patient's hand.3.Sit down when you talk.4.Get personal. Ask about personal things (eg, family).5.Focus on the patient's needs and listen and feel what those needs are.6.Determine whether the patient is really sick. Does the patient really need treatment or just some kindness and understanding?7.Learn to listen, look, and feel.8.Do not put your hand on the doorknob as you give advice.9.Always conclude with, \u201cIs there something else you want to tell me?\u201d10.Take the time to show the patient you care.As we lose time and have less time to give, we risk retreating from our covenant with the patient, we risk retreating from our covenant with students and residents, and we risk retreating from our covenant with society. If we continue to retreat, we will lose our patients and we will lose the viability of our specialty and the vitality of our profession. We will simply becomeproviders of healthcare, controlled and externally regulated. We will not be professionals, and we will not like it.In the ever increasing pace of the Internet, instant communication, and the ubiquitous cell phones and pagers, we are always reachable, always in touch. But perhaps we are not listening and communicating. Human interaction requires spending time, feeling, seeing, touching, smelling, and listening. We must listen to our patients and regain from society a trust in our profession. The patients will speak for us, the public will speak for us, IF WE CARE FOR THEM! We need our patients' trust now, and we will need it even more in the next millennium.We must find that timeless moment each day, for ourselves, for our families and loved ones, and for our patients. The timeless moment is a moment of instant communication and understanding, the communication and understanding that takes place between a couple in love, a mother and child, true friends, and a doctor and patient. It occurs when we say a prayer, establish a trust, and make a commitment. It is that commitment of a doctor to the patient.We must cherish and cultivate these timeless moments for the future. That is our challenge and our responsibility.",
  "2000": "For the times they are a-changin'Bob Dylan (1963)The 54th Annual Meeting of the Society for Vascular Surgery (SVS) is the first of the new millennium. Moving through the year 2000, we have had numerous opportunities to reflect on the amazing changes that our civilization has encountered in just the past century. We must recognize that the specialty of vascular surgery has existed for only a fraction of those 100 years. I, like many others in this room, have had the good fortune to participate in virtually all of the significant advances in this specialty since beginning my fellowship with Dr Thompson in 1974.More recently, as an officer of the SVS for the past 6 years, I have been intimately involved with the professional activities of our specialty. From this privileged perspective, I have gained an understanding of our Society's proud past and have formulated some ideas about its future directions. As we enter the 21st century, a brief historical review of the milestones of this organization will allow us to place the future in better perspective.The concept of forming a society devoted to vascular surgery was developed by Dr J. Ross Veal, who organized a meeting on December 5, 1945, at the Southern Surgical Association, in Hot Springs, Va.Attending this meeting to discuss this possibility were Drs Arthur Allen, Isaac A. Bigger, Arthur H. Blakemore, Barney Brooks, I. Mims Gage, and George D. Lilly. In San Francisco on July 3, 1946, the SVS was formed. There were 31 charter members, of whom only Drs Michael E. DeBakey and Harris B. Schumaker survive today. Dr Alton Ochsner was elected the first president, and the first scientific meeting of the SVS was held the following year in Atlantic City.Article II of the bylaws initially listed seven purposes of the Society, ranging from promotion, study, and research of vascular diseases to defining more clearly the role of surgery in vascular disease.Other purposes included the teaching of vascular diseases to students and house officers, encouraging development and special training for young surgeons interested in the field, and, finally, having annual meetings. The SVS has been a dynamic organization that has adapted over the years to meet the changing needs of our specialty. Initial presentations of the Society dealt with thrombophlebitis, prevention of pulmonary embolism, hypertension, treatment of congenital pulmonic stenosis, coarctation of the aorta, treatment of essential hypertension, and causalgia.Revascularization of the heart was first presented in 1948, and the initial paper on temporary artificial maintenance of circulation, the forerunner of the current heart-lung machine, was presented in 1949.Dr Robert R. Linton's address in 1948, entitled \u201cArteriosclerotic Popliteal Aneurysms,\u201d was the first presentation in which the surgical treatment of arterial disease was discussed. Basic research was first included in 1951, when a study entitled \u201cGrowth of Preserved Aorta Homografts\u2014an Experimental Study,\u201d by Dr Julian Johnson and his colleagues, and a paper entitled \u201cThe Experimental Study of Respiration Maintained by Homologous Lungs,\u201d by Wills Potts and his group, were presented. From this humble beginning, the SVS evolved through the years as a forum for presentations of cutting edge vascular research, which currently has evolved into the advanced techniques of cell biology, subcellular biochemistry, and gene manipulation. In 1950, the emphasis of the program focused increasingly on arterial occlusive disease of the intra-abdominal vessels, as well as femoral artery occlusive disease.In 1966, the SVS and the North American Chapter of the International Society for Cardiovascular Surgery (ISCVS) developed closer ties, with the two program committees meeting simultaneously. The Joint Council was formed to provide a governing body for both the North American Chapter and the SVS in 1975, and the following year, in Albuquerque, the societies had grown to the magnitude that a professional management group called PRRI was engaged to administer the scientific meeting and organizational business, a relationship that has been beneficial to our development and financial stability.In 1981, presentations on cardiac topics ceased to appear in the program because peripheral vascular surgery evolved separately from cardiac surgery.The SVS, in conjunction with the ISCVS, formed theJournal of Vascular Surgeryin 1983. This premier peer-reviewed scientific journal proved to be a milestone in establishing vascular surgery as a clearly defined specialty.As an adjunct, revenue from the publication provided the fiscal underpinning for many of the subsequent initiatives of the two societies.In the late 1980s, the Research Forum for basic investigative work was organized and incorporated as part of the scientific program, and the E. J. Wylie Traveling Fellowship was inaugurated. The Critical Issues Forum was initiated in 1988 and renamed the E. Stanley Crawford Critical Issues Forum in 1993. In 1984, the SVS Council began discussing the development of the Lifeline Foundation, an educational and research foundation. An initial contribution of $50,000 from the Society reserves was made to found this organization.The Lifeline Foundation supports research in vascular disease by enhancing the development of young surgical scientists and the advancement of vascular science through its comprehensive research funding. The foundation's mission provides a commitment to ensure that new knowledge concerning causes, treatment, and prevention of vascular disease is disseminated to the medical profession and the public. Calvin B. Ernst designed its logo. In 1992, the Lifeline Foundation started awarding the Resident Research Award, and more recently, in conjunction with the National Institutes of Health, has been able to fund investigators.As we look to chart our future course and define our mission, we need to have a clear understanding of why the SVS exists. This is a select society that recognizes academic excellence in vascular surgery. The privilege of membership is granted to vascular surgeons who have distinguished themselves with applied clinical or basic science research. Membership is a valued accomplishment and a reward of exceptional scholarship.With the honor of membership comes a responsibility to lead and to teach. For beyond the recognition of membership in a prestigious organization, the foremost mission of the SVS must be to maintain a link to those for whom we care\u2014our patients. Vascular surgery needs to embrace a commitment to issues of patient education. It is important for our patients to realize the value of high-quality vascular surgery provided by our members, because ultimately, it is the citizens of our countries who will determine the viability of our specialty. This is going to be one of the more difficult tasks for our Society. We have done an excellent job of establishing the value of our work to our colleagues in surgery. These efforts need to be continued on a much grander scale. The development of the Society's Web site is an important beginning, but in this technologically advanced information age, we need to expand these efforts. The world must be able to appreciate our contributions and recognize the importance of vascular surgery in the health care of our countries. Other surgical organizations have invested significant resources in developing elaborate electronic media programs. It is important for our Society to maintain a proactive stance that effectively educates the public regarding the value of vascular surgery.We also need to establish relationships with our colleagues internationally. We have become global citizens, and the worldwide instantaneous electronic transfer of information essentially eliminates geographical professional boundaries. At the European Society for Vascular Surgery (ESVS) meeting in Copenhagen, I participated in their program directors of vascular surgery meeting and can report to you that the problems facing European vascular surgeons in terms of practice and training were similar to our own. Maintaining a global dialogue will expose the SVS to the innovative solutions of our international colleagues, with mutual benefit. Discussions have begun to develop closer collaboration with the leaders of the ESVS, with the consideration of joint meetings. These efforts will be continued by President-Elect Ramon Berguer this next year.At this point let me move on to what I believe are four basic problems confronting the specialty of vascular surgery and therefore becoming the charge of this Society. For these challenges we have a responsibility to provide leadership into the next millennium.First is the need for the ongoing development of basic researchThe advances cataloged in the rich history of this specialty would not have occurred without dedication and financial commitment to answering basic questions about the diseases we treat.Second is the need to adapt to the rapidly changing field of endovascular surgeryThere has been a virtual revolution in the treatment of abdominal aortic aneurysms, with a variety of endovascular devices (two have been currently approved) working their way through various levels of the Food and Drug Administration's regulatory process. Percutaneous angioplasty and stenting have become the standard of care in iliac occlusive disease. Currently, endovascular techniques are being investigated for the treatment of carotid artery disease.Third is the need to deal with fiscal issuesThe declines in reimbursement to vascular surgeons by the Health Care Financing Administration, coupled with a ratcheting down of expenditures by health maintenance organizations and other insurance carriers, must remain a major concern for our specialty.Fourth is the need to recognize the continuing evolution of vascular surgery as a distinct specialtyWe have evolved from a time when those with only basic surgical training performed vascular surgery, to one where an increasingly greater percentage of vascular surgery is performed by those with specialized vascular training. With potential changes in the structure of surgical training programs, altered reimbursement profiles, and evolution of more complex endovascular techniques, a greater proportion of vascular surgery will, and should, be done by vascular surgeons.ResearchFunding still remains very problematic, and with the increasing emphasis on practice incomes by deans and department chairs, medical schools are less inclined to place emphasis on basic investigation. It is critical that our young faculty members have time and resources to allow them to develop their careers as scientists. Our Society needs to play an active role in the support of basic science laboratory investigation. The formation of the Lifeline Foundation was a beginning. The annual Research Initiatives Conference with very successful collaboration with investigators at the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute needs continued support. We need to be diligent mentors for young academic vascular surgeons. The program on Wednesday dealing with scientific communication and grantsmanship is another facet of developing research talent that deserves our commitment.Endovascular surgeryThe SVS needs to encourage the continued development of endovascular surgery and ensure that vascular surgeons play a significant role in its practice. We have demonstrated that vascular surgeons can master these techniques. The development of a session of this meeting dedicated solely to endovascular surgery indicates the strides that our members have made in this now rapidly emerging field. It is important for vascular surgeons to maintain their hegemony in the treatment of all aspects of vascular occlusive disease. In the operating room, portable digital fluoroscopy units with road mapping capability may well become the pocket Doppler transducer of the next generation of vascular surgeons. Sophisticated radiologic techniques and the associated hardware must be part of the armamentarium of the modern-day vascular surgeon.There are a variety of strategies to achieve these goals; they will depend on local customs and experience. One paradigm is the traditional combination of interventional radiologists working in concert with vascular surgeons. This relationship obviously will require compromise on occasion. As in most business situations, the difficulty comes in negotiating the fiscal relationships. A second strategy for an endovascular program involves the vascular surgeon performing and controlling all aspects of diagnosis and treatment of vascular disease. Certainly, this model is the most efficient way of ensuring that vascular surgeons are skillful with catheter technology. Within some medical centers, this may result in a rather contentious environment and may not be applicable for all. Another relationship may find vascular surgeons working with cardiologists. Interventional cardiologists are relatively new participants, in terms of those who perform peripheral vascular interventions. They often have good catheter skills and are frequently willing to collaborate with vascular surgeons in a vascular disease unit, which could be mutually beneficial.We need to work with the program directors in vascular surgery and the American Board of Surgery's Sub-board of Vascular Surgery to ensure that our vascular surgery fellows have been fully exposed to all modalities of vascular intervention before they complete their training. To be competitive in the marketplace, vascular surgeons must be involved in the evolution in endovascular techniques.The use of stented grafts for the treatment of aneurysm disease clearly demonstrates the need for sophisticated experience in the management of patients treated with this new technology. The high incidence of technical complications with these grafts on long-term follow-up demonstrates the need for savvy clinical judgment and for ongoing development of interventional techniques with more advanced technology. Research into the effect of endoluminal devices on the progression of abdominal aortic aneurysm disease and the ultimate morbidity and mortality of endoluminal repair needs continuous, rigorous surveillance and analysis. Although recent efforts have focused on product development, in the future we must better understand the interactions between the aortic wall and the endoluminal device. We must establish a basic science foundation on which further advances in product development can be built.Reimbursement and government relationsThe SVS must continue to support the ongoing work of the Government Relations Committee of the Joint Council. Initial work in this area in dealing with the Health Care Financing Administration was undertaken by Norm Hertzer, who was followed by Hugh Trout. Currently, Bob Zwolak leads this effort for our profession. Despite the intense work of the Government Relations Committee, success has been limited to restoring a few percentage points to the Medicare fee schedule. These gains have not been enough to counteract the large cuts that were originally instituted without our participation in the resource-based relative value scale process. The recent success of Bob Zwolak and Gary Seabrook in obtaining work values for 14 new Current Procedural Terminology codes for endovascular repair of abdominal aortic aneurysms is a significant accomplishment. With component coding methodology, placement of a typical aortic endograft will be assigned a number of relative value units, which is slightly above the work value for conventional, open aneurysm repair. With luck, this will serve as a benchmark to increase other vascular surgery codes in the future. Because of the work of this Committee, at least in the short term, the fiscal integrity of vascular surgery has been tenuously preserved. However, we must accept that there will be an ongoing battle to be waged over the next decade.The next issue that is going to affect medicine has to do with the concept of establishing ongoing credentialing.The SVS has been a leader in this for the last decade and a half. Dr William J. Fry appointed an outcomes committee when he was president that began our involvement in this area. Dr Norman Hertzer stressed the importance of outcomes in his presidential address. Vascular surgery has led the way in the studying of outcomes. Carotid endarterectomy is probably the best studied clinical entity in the history of medicine, in terms of disease progression and the effect of surgical intervention on the occurrence and survival of stroke. As certifying boards develop standards for concurrent credentialing of surgical specialists, vascular surgery is in a superb position to lead the way, because much of the outcome data on which the surgical competence is based has already been collected. These data will undoubtedly demonstrate that fully trained vascular surgeons have better mortality and morbidity profiles and that quality care, in the long term, costs less.Vascular surgery as a distinct specialtyThe most important challenge we face is the continuing evolution of vascular surgery as a distinct specialty. The development of theJournal of Vascular Surgeryinto the premier vascular journal in the world has established our scientific and academic credentials. The Association of Program Directors of Vascular Surgery has defined the body of knowledge encompassed by the specialty of vascualr surgery with the development of curriculum for vascular laboratory, clinical, and basic science. The creation of a Sub-board of Vascular Surgery in the American Board of Surgery has led to all aspects of the examination and certification of vascular surgeons being conducted by vascular surgeons. The formation of the Advisory Committee on Vascular Surgery by the American College of Surgeons is the acknowledgment by the largest surgical organization in North America that we are a separate and clearly defined specialty.It is important to view these changes as an evolution. The current status will continue to evolve as the needs of our vascular surgery trainees change. I have proposed to the Sub-board of Vascular Surgery that the Residency Review Committee (RRC) for Surgery be petitioned to develop a Sub-RRC for Vascular Surgery. This will better meet the needs of our vascular fellowship programs. The RRC for Radiology has successfully created such an entity by developing a separate RRC for both Diagnostic Radiology and Radiation Therapy. We have evolved from a time when vascular surgery was a mere component of a general surgeon's repertoire, to a time when increasingly, a greater proportion of vascular surgery is performed by those with specialized training. We need to maintain our standard of quality and continue to strive for technical excellence.These are exciting and challenging times. When confronted with conflict or competition, an organization must anticipate change, react rapidly, respond intelligently, and embrace the newest ideas. It is certain that the SVS needs to be proactive as it continues its leadership role into this new and challenging era. As we have done many times in our first 54 years, we need to continue to adapt to the changing needs of our specialty. Aware of its proud past, the SVS needs to continue to meet the rapidly changing needs of the future.These times as never before are times of change. Every aspect of our professional life is under siege. The opportunity to seize the initiative and to create a vascular disease treatment model for the coming years is upon us. Change is not limited to our professional lives, but involves the whole of society. It is estimated that the population will double in the next 30 years and that the ethnic mix of that population will change as well. The rate of new developments is greater than has ever been encountered in the history of civilization. Just look at computer technology as an example. New developments remain \u201ccutting edge\u201d for months,notyears. With this explosion of technology come quantum leaps in the fund of information available to the populace. What is awesome today, with the advances in the Internet, is that a poor farmer in a Third World country has an opportunity to have access to almost the same information as a graduate student at one of our most prestigious universities.Change observes no loyalties and rewards only those who are nimble and can most quickly react to the new priorities. We cannot let old ideas that have become obsolete consume our time and energy. We must go forward in our thinking and have a \u201ccan do\u201d attitude. We must be able to think \u201coutside the box\u201d and recognize that some of the issues that were dominant in running our organizations are no longer relevant, no matter the investment of time, energy, and even emotional zeal. We must realize when it is time to move ahead and not be hamstrung by old ideals, old wars, and old disagreements.My favorite car as a high school and college student was a '55 Chevy with three deuces as carburetors and a Hurst floor shift and glass packs. This car got 6 mpg and polluted the environment. As wonderful as they may seem in retrospect to some, the 1950s are over. As far as vascular surgery is concerned, the '80s and '90s are over. We will surely cherish those times as we reminisce in years to come, but they are over. We need to adapt and move forward. For those of us that are older, this is difficult, because we tend to be set in our ways. In reality, our only option is to get with the program.The SVS needs to look to our younger members for counsel and advice. They have grown up in this information age and probably can adapt better, at least I hope so. My chief criticism of all surgical organizations in which I participate is that they are often dominated by the elders, the group that is the least able to react to the issues for change and who are reactionary in thought and ideas. We must not continue to fight past wars instead of dealing with future changes. We must be broad-minded enough to listen to the ideas of others, we must have the intellectual courage and confidence to come to consensus, and we must realize that in the give and take of an organization, no one gets everything he supports. We have to critically look at the agenda of our Society and have the courage to discard tenets that are no longer meaningful. Most difficult of all, we the leaders need to know how, with grace, to pass on the torch to the next generation and complete the transition from leader to wise senior adviser.In conclusion, let me return to the ballad of Bob Dylan who was perhaps more prophetic than we might have ever imagined when he wrote these words in 1963:Come gather \u2018round people Wherever you roam And admit that the waters Around you have grown And accept it that soon You'll be drenched to the bone, If your time to you is worth savin' Then you better start swimmin' Or you'll sink like a stone, For the times they are a-changin'.The line it is drawn The curse it is cast The slow one now will Later be fast. As the present now Will later be past The order is rapidly fadin' And the first one now Will later be last For the times they are a-changin'.*It has been a privilege to serve as your president. We must permit these changing times to lead us toward a bright future. Thank you.",
  "2001": "My thanks to you, members of the Society, for the honor of having served as your president. There is no higher reward for a vascular surgeon. As I stand here to give the Presidential Address to the most distinguished vascular society in the world, I feel humbled\u2014not in the sense of being diminished\u2014but in the profound respect I have for your judgment.This has been an intense year. Many of our emerging concerns were brought to open debate in which the membership participated in unprecedented numbers. Not surprisingly, I will speak today about our emerging new identity, about the difficult interaction with the discipline from which we originated and about the powers we need to assume to ensure our position as the discipline that can best provide vascular care to the American people.Vascular surgery has been a specialty for years. Our identity underwent a dramatic change when the new imaging and endovascular technologies expanded the scientific and technical content of our specialty. We moved from the old descriptions of \u201cgeneral and vascular\u201d or \u201ccardiovascular\u201d to the new identity of \u201cvascular and endovascular.\u201dVascular surgery was born of general and thoracic surgery. Our birth and growth were the result of the appearance of two techniques\u2014endarterectomy and bypass\u2014and two technologies\u2014angiography and prosthetic grafts. After the expected phase of rapid growth and accommodation with other specialty fields, our discipline became relatively stable in the 1980s. Then, 15 and 10 years ago, the appearance of two new technologies\u2014stents and stent-grafts\u2014caused a major disturbance in our steady system because they were used as tentative substitutes for open surgery and were available to other specialties that had the mechanical skills for their use.Within a decade, about 20% of our surgical procedures were replaced by endovascular treatments with many of them not being done by vascular surgeons. We rushed to offer practicing vascular surgeons crash courses in the new technologies and included endovascular skills as part of the training of our fellows. As we struggled in this competitive environment, we felt that we were politically restrained in how we train our fellows and how we define our specialty.Self reflection is a prologue of freedom and survival, the idea being that only when we understand ourselves can we gain control over the direction in which we ought to move. Let us see where we are.The old paradigmThe powerful conglomerate of the American Board of Surgery (ABS), the Residency Review Committee\u2013surgery (RRC\u2013surgery), the American Surgical Association, and the American College of Surgeons sponsors a vision of general surgery based in the paradigm of a widely trained surgeon, able to apply surgical skills to a variety of systems and conditions. In this paradigm, vascular surgery is designated a primary component of general surgery. This clearly implies that our entire discipline is seen as a part of what is considered general surgery. The expectation of this view of general surgery is the graduation of surgeons approaching, or perhaps endowed with, almost universal competence in the field of general surgery. A nice utopia, but not quite the one we live in.Paradigms can be asked to show their worth, and, when asked, some of them do not stand up. Let us see how the traditional general surgical paradigm stands up to examination as a method for training and certifying vascular surgeons, advancing research, and providing optimal patient care, the latter being the primary reason for the system to exist.TrainingGeneral surgeons spend 5 to 7 years in training. Two additional years are now required for a vascular fellow who, upon graduation, will be a \u201cdoubly boarded\u201d surgeon. A mere 10% of these doubly boarded surgeons will use infrequently the general surgical skills they spent years acquiring. By the end of their training, vascular surgeons will have spent more time learning advanced general surgical skills they will never use than the vascular skills that will be the essence of their daily work.A minority of graduates from general surgery programs will be doing some vascular operations, and their limited skills in this field will yield predictably inferior outcomes. This is another flaw of the present system. We certify two tiers of vascular surgeons, those who do it by virtue of having a General Surgery Board certification and those who have special training in vascular surgery through a fellowship.Consider now the cost and effort of this training enterprise. Marshall Webster,in his Presidential Address to the Society for Clinical Vascular Surgery 2 months ago, described the prototypical vascular fellow graduating after 7 to 9 years of training as being 33 to 35 years of age and having accumulated an education debt of $200,000. It is not surprising that programs that require 7 to 9 years in training are having difficulty matching their positions.In the residency match of 2001, 510 of the 2035 positions in general surgery were unfilled, an unprecedented match failure rate of 25%. This is an alarming problem. Second-rate candidates may eventually fill some of these 510 vacancies. It is from this stream of general surgery residents that, 4 years from now, we will be attempting to recruit our vascular fellows. It is certain that the problem we already have recruiting attractive residents to vascular fellowships will continue to worsen. This is one dismal consequence of being at the bottom of the food chain.The length of training and the decrease in quality of the applicant pool are probably not the only reasons for the lack of appeal of vascular surgery fellowships. Other negative considerations may be the decreased reimbursement for effort, the demands that our practice places on our personal life, and the perception that vascular surgeons are becoming the \u201ccleaning brigade\u201d for other endovascular specialties.The reason for our lengthy training is the principle that a vascular surgeon needs a full general surgical education. Why is this so? We have already defined and stereotyped the approach to any blood vessel that may need to be repaired. There is no evidence that spending 2 or 3 years learning how to perform a hepatectomy or a laparoscopic colectomy will improve the performance of a vascular surgeon. It may sound repugnant to some, but we need to modify deontologic principles\u2014such as the need for full general surgery training\u2014with the reality that the growth of vascular science and technology requires a different approach to making vascular surgeons.Patient careI mentioned that the present system graduates two tiers of surgeons who will perform vascular surgery with different levels of expertise. This is not acceptable to offer to the American public. The argument that rural general surgeons need to be able to do vascular surgery\u2014for instance, to treat ruptured aneurysms\u2014is negated by the fact that more than 95% of the American population lives within 2 hours of transportation to a center with major surgical facilities. Complex surgical problems fare best when transported to regional centers with trained specialists and adequate facilities.Fading away are times when the possession of a Board certification in general surgery entitles its holder to apply for privileges to perform all the operations ascribed to this discipline. Our government agencies and third-party payors are demanding the implementation of measures for patient safety and professional competence. The American Board of Medical Specialties (ABMS) is championing a movement for competence evaluation through its member boards. Measurement of outcomes will be one of the tools used for the evaluation of competence. General surgeons doing occasional vascular surgery will be identified by their inferior outcomes. I invite you to reject the pretense that today the exposure of a general surgeon to vascular cases during training carries the right to request privileges in our specialty. This is not a turf issue; it is an issue of competence.ResearchMolecular biology is the undisputed discipline to advance research in medicine. Academic surgery, as all the other major medical disciplines, chose molecular biology as its main research avenue. But by focusing almost all research effort into that, we turned away from the source of many of our successes.I mentioned that vascular surgery was born because two surgical techniques and two technologies appeared in the surgical field. Consider now the advances that have improved surgery in the last 25 years; laparoscopic and endovascular techniques are at the top. These were technologic\u2014not biologic\u2014discoveries. However, laparoscopic and endovascular techniques were viewed with disdain by the academic community and were mostly developed by the private sector. Imaging techniques\u2014again a technologic development\u2014also had a profound effect on surgery. Another refinement of our practices is the study of outcomes, basically an empirical method for rating the health value of our work. Surgical advances have been the consequence of devising new tools and new techniques. And our clinical performance improves when we apply functional metrics of outcomes to rationalize indications.In the intellectual ranking of human endeavors, science comes first, art is second, and technology a distant third. And yet historians of science and art progressively recognize the seminal importance of technology, even the most primitive ones, as the prelude to all of the monumental changes in science. The Chinese fireworks of 2000 years ago inspired both the chemical experimentation of propellants and the flight mechanics of today's rockets and missiles. The gyroscopes that guide these missiles originated in a common toy, the spinning top. The monumental fountains of the eighteenth century propelled the discipline of hydraulics. Discovery is art, curiosity, and aesthetics\u2014not logic. Intellectual analysis follows\u2014does not precede\u2014discovery. When it seems to precede discovery, it is only because scientific reports are written in a sterile and dispassionate manner, presenting the discovery as the logical consequence of a prior hypothesis and search. Necessity may be the mother of improvement\u2014not of invention. Invention is not programmable.I am not suggesting that we should abandon molecular biology research. I am saying that it needs not to be the boot camp of all vascular surgical research. We would do well to shed the supercilious attitude toward technology. Do we suffer a touch of an undeserved inferiority complex with regards to the academic disciplines that sport a \u201cbasic science\u201d background? Again, paradigms can be asked to prove their worth. Our general research plan needs to be questioned.Most technologic advances come from industry, and their clinical trials are regulated by government agencies. The role of vascular surgeons has been mostly limited to that of the worker bees in the performance of the trials. This year, your society established a Board of Technology and Clinical Studies. This is an effort to give vascular surgeons a more decisive protagonism in the design, evaluation, and clinical application of technologic advances. The Board will advise industry and the Food and Drug Administration on the scientific and ethical value of technologic designs and protocols, and it will act as a clearinghouse\u2014connected to industry and to the Food and Drug Administration\u2014for innovative ideas from vascular surgeons.The board questionWell-established institutions bristle when the validity of their traditional philosophy is questioned. The following was the Vatican's answer to Galileo's heliocentric view of our planetary system.\u201cPropositions to be forbidden:\u2022That the Sun is immovable at the center of Heavens.\u2022That the Earth is not at the center of Heaven and is not immovable, but moves in a double motion.\u201dFor a while our request to the ABS for a separate specialty board was met with irritation. After we continued to accumulate evidence that our needs were not served by the general surgery paradigm, the ABS suggested a Council for Vascular Surgery in 1997. This concession was mostly a formality and went nowhere in addressing our concerns. A year later, the ABS appointed a Vascular Sub-Board that has now been renamed the Vascular Board of the ABS. The word from this Vascular Board of the ABS is that all of the important pending issues of the vascular community have been resolved. This is an elegant application of Baltasar Gracian's aphorism, \u201cfor a thing to remain undone, nothing more is needed than to think it done.\u201d In fact, an abbreviated list of unresolved issues important to the vascular community will read as follows.\u2022Vascular surgery should cease to be designated a \u201cprimary component\u201d of general surgery.\u2022We need a new training paradigm for vascular surgery.\u2022We need an independent board and an independent RRC\u2013vascular to regulate our training and certification and to define vascular surgery as an independent specialty in front of the public, our government, and the health care agencies.They tell us that we are few in number and that our board would have a small voice. It is true that the restrictions imposed on our education programs over the years kept our numbers down. Now, at the rate at which our practice erodes and our fellowship programs dwindle, we risk being fewer tomorrow. If our numbers decrease and our relevance as the best-suited specialists to provide care for vascular diseases is lost, our future will be in question. As Stephen Gould put it, \u201cyou can be the most beautiful fish that ever swam. You can be perfectly equipped to survive. Then, one day, the pond you live in dries up, and that's it, you die, no matter how fit you are.\u201dWill our board be too small? It would be almost the size of the Board of Neurological Surgery that has served its discipline well. They tell us, too, that we may not be able to afford the cost of a separate board; we commissioned a study from a former executive of the ABMS and the conclusion was that the operation of our board would be budget neutral.Even the most recalcitrant defenders of the status quo admit that inevitably and eventually we will have a separate Board. But, they add, it is not yet the time. Who will decide that the time has come? Wouldn't that warm your heart to know that we can continue to work quietly with the knowledge that someone, sometime, will see that the time has arrived and eventually nod approval?Last year we asked the vascular surgery community whether an independent Board would be supported; two thirds responded in the affirmative. Support was even stronger (79%) among younger surgeons with fewer than 10 years of practice. It is hard to escape the suggestion that those in the front lines feel closer to the insecurity of our situation and have doubts that the present system can make the necessary changes. The issue of an independent board has been labeled divisive. It may be so, but how could we place\u2014for the sake of harmony\u2014the will of the majority of vascular surgeons back in the closet?Opposition to the questionnaire and to the implementation of its results has been predictably strong among vascular surgeons who serve in the bodies that oversee the present general surgical paradigm (RRC-surgery, ABS, American Surgical Association, Vascular Board of the ABS, etc). The suggestion that the opinion of some of these respected surgeons who oppose independence might have been influenced by loyalty to the general surgery institutions in which they serve has inexplicably offended some of them. Such a statement was not intended to question anyone's ethics; it simply acknowledged a plain fact of life. After all, the objects of our loyalties exert a reciprocal influence on us; we are loyal to them, and they helped define our beliefs. The principle that general surgery is an indivisible discipline made up of various primary components must be shared and supported by all those who serve in the higher councils of surgery. And this principle is threatened by evidence that the majority of vascular surgeons want independence from general surgery.It is common sense, and not reproachable, that the web of loyalties and interdependencies that surround us influences our opinions. As Herbert Spencer put it, \u201copinion is ultimately determined by the feelings, and not by the intellect.\u201d Opinions are not mathematical propositions. They cannot be proven or disproved by logical derivations; they are resolved by vote.The road to independence may not be rosy and may be lengthy (perhaps 3 to 5 years)\u2014but it has to start somewhere. As we debate and vote on this issue, remember, above all, that the younger vascular surgeons and those in training have overwhelmingly supported independence. You are the ultimate voice of our society. Your vote will determine how this movement proceeds.The new paradigmIf vascular surgery is to continue to provide the American people the highest level of care for vascular diseases, we need to change our training and certification programs. As practitioners of an empirical discipline, we should approach decisions concerning education and training from a utilitarian and not an axiomatic point of view. We should use the mindset of an engineer rather than that of a judge.We need to attract bright individuals who will have a full complement of competitive skills after a sensible training period. This will require important changes that will affect both vascular and general surgery training programs. These changes should ideally be negotiated with the ABS, respecting the interests of both parties.The education of a vascular surgeon should include general surgical skills and principles, and critical care and trauma management. Training in vascular surgery should include diagnosis of vascular diseases, the use of different imaging technologies (ultrasound scanning, magnetic resonance imaging, angiography), and the direct and endovascular alternatives for therapy. Training could be accomplished in 6 years. The scheme could be 2 (general surgery) + 4 (vascular surgery) years or 3 (general surgery) + 3 (vascular surgery) years.This training scheme will give us a training period similar to that of other surgical specialties that matured and departed from the trunk of surgery, such as orthopedics or urology. A total length of training of 6 years would also be similar to that of most of the medical and radiologic subspecialties.Concomitantly, the specialty of general surgery should define itself realistically and specify the vascular skills that are to be part of a general surgeon's curriculum. The vascular services would be responsible for teaching those skills to general surgery residents.Vascular surgery graduates from such a training scheme would not be eligible to qualify for ABS certification. An independent American Board of Vascular Surgery would be required to certify a vascular surgical education and to define to the public what is a vascular surgeon and what educational attributes are required to become one. The certification of our own training programs will require an independent RRC\u2013vascular surgery.For an argument to be worth making, it must be framed in a language that appeals to persons who may have interests competing with those of the proponent. The case for us is how to train and certify surgeons that will provide optimal treatment for vascular diseases.After the response of the vascular community to our questionnaire, Dr Robert Hobson and I brought the following propositions to the ABS for consideration:\u2022a new paradigm of training that expands the vascular surgery education at the expense of general surgery;\u2022an independent American Board of Vascular Surgery ideally established with the support of the ABS, described as a board \u201cdown the corridor from ABS.\u201d The composition of this board could be 5 directors nominated from the ABS, 5 from the national societies, and 5 from the regional societies. It would include two directors, one nominated by the American Board of Radiology (interventional) and one from the American Board of Internal Medicine (Cardiology);\u2022an RRC for vascular surgery.Whether or not the ABS supports these proposals, we need to prepare and file an application with the ABMS because this process will be a long one, measured in years. Although I am not optimistic following our initial contact, we cannot infer from past experience how the ABS will react to these proposals. The two parties\u2014vascular surgery and general surgery\u2014are in a different position today than they were when they discussed these matters 5 years ago. The traditional general surgery paradigm of training shows clear signs of deterioration across the country and is not well rated by senior medical student choices. The content of vascular surgery has greatly expanded, and we see the need for a more agile and focused education to attract more and better trainees. It would make sense for the ABS of today to support our independence as we both renovate our training programs and we commit ourselves\u2014within the family of surgery\u2014to the larger goal of providing optimal care for our patients.As I take my leave, I thank you again for the great privilege you have given me and for your involvement in the crucial matters that concern us.Farewell.",

  "2003": "Sic semper tyrannis(Thus always to tyrants) was the phrase uttered by John Wilkes Booth as he leaped 10 feet to the stage floor below from the Presidential box at Ford Theater after firing the fatal bullet into the brain of President Abraham Lincoln on Good Friday, Apr 14, 1865. Booth, an accomplished actor, was known for daring jumps and leaps during his performances, but on this occasion, after struggling in the Presidential box and stabbing Major Henry Rathbone, Booth was off balance and caught his spur in an American flag draped over the balcony, and landed awkwardly on the stage. This misstep resulted in a fractured fibula, and although Booth was mobile, he was now in need of medical attention. The resulting treatment of this fracture dramatically altered the life of one of our early medical colleagues, Dr Samuel Alexander Mudd.Dr Mudd was born on Dec 20, 1833, in Charles County, Maryland, where he became a farmer and a practicing physician after attending Georgetown College in Washington, DC, and ultimately graduating from the University of Maryland in Baltimore in 1856 after studying medicine and surgery. Times were hard because the country was in a depression, but Dr Mudd developed a successful medical practice and married his childhood sweetheart, Sarah Frances Dyer, on Nov 26, 1857. When shots were fired at Fort Sumter in Charleston Harbor on Apr 12, 1861, additional southern states seceded to join the fledgling Confederacy, but Maryland was not among them. Maryland was a border state, with a large number of Confederate sympathizers, including Dr Mudd. He continued his life as a physician and farmer during the ensuing Civil War, but was most likely a member of the Confederate underground and subsequently became acquainted with some soon-to-be famous people.In fact, Dr Mudd had met John Wilkes Booth on at least 3 previous occasions. Six months earlier, on Nov 13, 1864, Booth had attended St Mary's Church near Bryantown and was introduced to Dr Mudd, and possibly spent the night in his home. On Dec 18, 1864, in the Bryantown Tavern, and again on Dec 23, 1864, Dr Mudd had meetings with Booth, and introduced him first to Mr Thomas Harbin and later to John Surratt, both known Confederate Secret Service operatives with extensive local knowledge of the countryside, which Booth would need to aid him in a grand scheme to kidnap President Lincoln and take him to Richmond, Virginia, as a hostage to exchange for Confederate prisoners of war or to force a peace treaty favorable to the South.Booth recruited additional help for his abduction plan, including David Herold, Louis Payne, George Atzerodt, Michael O'Laughlin, and Samuel Arnold. An initial plan for abduction of Lincoln on March 17 failed when President Lincoln changed his schedule, and some of the conspirators lost heart and abandoned the group. Booth, however, had previously confided to his friends a desire to kill Lincoln. After the surrender of General Robert E. Lee to General Ulysses S. Grant on Apr 9, 1865, Booth began to organize a new plan, one of assassination. The evening of Apr 14 was selected for George Atzerodt to assassinate Vice President Andrew Johnson; Lewis Paine and David Herold were to kill Secretary of State William Seward; and John Wilkes Booth made plans to assassinate President Lincoln. (It is interesting to note, considering today's world, that Booth was able to visit the President's box on the afternoon of the assassination to drill a peephole in the door of the box and to later enter the box unchallenged because the single guard, Mr John Parker, had left the area to get a better view of the play!) During a key moment of laughter in the play,Our American Cousin,Booth entered the Presidential box, fired a single shot from his .44-caliber derringer into Lincoln's head behind his left ear, stabbed Major Rathbone, and leaped to the stage. Atzerodt had done some heavy drinking, but still lost his courage, and abandoned the attack on Vice President Johnson; Lewis Paine had seriously wounded Secretary of State Seward with a knife. David Herold was outside guarding Paine's mount, but subsequently fled on hearing screams from the Seward household.Herold and John Wilkes Booth met each other en route to Lloyd's Tavern in Surrattsville, Maryland, which was owned and operated by Mary Surratt (the mother of John Surratt). Whiskey was retrieved for self-medication, along with a package containing field glasses and a Spencer rifle that had been previously stored. Whether the original escape route was to proceed to Dr Mudd's home or was required because of Booth's injury is the subject of continued debate. At 4:00amon Apr 15, 1865, Dr Mudd and his wife Sarah were awakened by 2 men banging loudly on the door of their home near Bryantown, Maryland. The horsemen identified themselves as \u201cstrangers from St Mary County\u201d who were on their way to Washington, DC, when one of the men's horses fell and the rider's leg was broken. The injured man had a mustache and long chin whiskers. Dr Mudd later told interrogators that he did not recognize either man. He cut off the patient's boot, and after examining the leg concluded that the patient had a simple fracture of the fibula, 2 inches above the ankle. Dr Mudd set the fracture, and cut up a wooden box to fashion a splint for it. The injured man was put to bed, and Dr Mudd and the other traveler went to Mudd's father's farm and subsequently to Bryantown in search of a carriage or wagon to transport the patient. When none was available, the stranger returned to Mudd's farm while Mudd stayed in Bryantown to do some shopping. Soldiers were bustling about, and there was news of the assassination of President Lincoln, possibly by a man named Booth. The soldiers, however, had inadvertently picked up fliers with a picture of Edwin Booth, John Wilkes Booth's brother, and Dr Mudd would later testify that while in Bryantown he did not recognize the face on this flier as anyone he knew. On later returning to his farm around 5:00pm, Mudd found the 2 men saddling their horses and preparing to leave. He directed the riders on a route through the Zekiah swamp. Mudd had his handyman make a pair of rough crutches for the injured man, and was paid $25 for his \u201cglobal\u201d services to the patient, but later testified he would have been willing to accept a lesser fee. On his return to the house, Sarah informed him that the injured man's beard was a disguise. The Mudds later testified that they were shocked at the realization of the possible identity of their visitors, but inasmuch as night was approaching, Sarah was afraid for her husband to leave, lest the 2 men might return. (What Sam knew and when he knew it would later become a significant issue). Sam waited until the next day, after Easter Sunday mass, to report the information to his cousin, another practicing physician, Dr George Mudd, who was a strong Union supporter. George agreed to pass the information along to the military, but did not do so until the next day, Monday. The soldiers in turn waited another day before coming to Sam Mudd's farm on Tuesday, Apr 18. Dr Mudd provided the valuable information of the route through the Zekiah swamp that the 2 had taken, and also that 1 of the men had a broken leg. The army officers searched the area and rode off, but returned 3 days later to conduct a further search. At this time Sarah presented the soldiers with the patient's cut boot that she had found, and in it was inscribed \u201cHenry Lutz, Maker, 445 Broadway, New York, J. Wilkes.\u201d Now the identity of the injured man was confirmed, and the officer, Lieutenant Alexander Lovett, abruptly changed his demeanor and \u201cinvited\u201d Dr Mudd to accompany him to Bryantown for further questioning. The questions continued through the weekend, and on Monday, Apr 24, Sarah received news that her husband had been arrested for participation in the murder of President Abraham Lincoln! The assassin, John Wilkes Booth, was still at large.While Dr Mudd was in jail and the other conspirators were being rounded up, the search intensified for David Herold and John Wilkes Booth. Booth and Herold had traveled to the home of Samuel Cox, where they were given food and hid in the woods for 3 days before crossing the Potomac River to the presumed safety of Virginia. There was, however, a $100,000 reward on their heads, and Union soldiers were searching everywhere. Despite the reward, their escape attempt was aided by many southern sympathizers, and they arrived at Richard Garrett's farm south of the Rappahanock River near Port Royal on Apr 24. Time was running out, however, because a fellow passenger on the river ferry tipped off the Union soldiers, who on Apr 26 surrounded the Garrett tobacco barn in which Herold and Booth were hiding. The soldiers threatened to burn the barn, and David Herold surrendered. Booth refused to come out, and the barn was set on fire. As Booth hobbled within the burning barn, he was shot in the neck by Sergeant Thomas \u201cBoston\u201d Corbett and sustained a fatal spinal cord wound that severed the cord at the C4-5 level. He was paralyzed, but lived for 3 more hours, and stated before dying, \u201cTell my mother that what I did, I did for the good of the country.\u201d Herold was returned to Washington and imprisoned with the other accused conspirators: Atzerodt and Paine, who had come to the boarding house (and frequent conspirator meeting place) of Mary Surratt while she was in the process of being arrested; Ned Spangler, who had aided Booth's escape from the theater; O'Laughlin and Arnold, who had abandoned the group after the failed abduction; and our own Samuel Mudd.The trial that followed for the defendants began on May 9, and was a military tribunal with 7 generals and 2 colonels sitting on the court, and a prosecutor who had served as the Secretary of War and had recently turned down the job of Attorney General. Things did not look good for the accused, who were granted legal counsel only 1 day before the trial began and were denied the opportunity to testify in their own defense! The first witnesses were heard on May 12, and the trial was completed on July 5. The prisoners were notified of the findings on July 6. All were declared guilty, and Herold, Atzerodt, Paine, and Mary Surratt were condemned to die the next day. Spangler was sentenced to 6 years at hard labor. Arnold, O'Laughlin, and Dr Mudd were sentenced to life in prison. Dr Mudd was spared the death penalty by 1 vote.The next day, July 7, the 4 condemned prisoners were hung in the penitentiary courtyard. Appeals and a plea for mercy to President Johnson on behalf of Mary Surratt were unsuccessful, and he was quoted as saying she \u201ckept the nest that hatched the egg.\u201d The 4 remaining prisoners were shackled in irons and chains and sent by boat to Fort Jefferson, an island prison in the Dry Tortugas, between Florida and Cuba, likened to Alcatraz or Devil's Island, from which escape would be difficult, as would communication with friends, family, and legal counsel.They arrived on July 24, 1865, and their spirits were not brightened by threats of punishment in the dungeon portion, where the door bore a quote fromParadise Lost:\u201cWhoso entereth here leaveth all hopes behind.\u201d Sam Mudd would have an opportunity to pass through this portal in chains after a botched escape attempt on Sept 25, 1865, 2 months after arriving, as he attempted to stow away on an outgoing vessel, theThomas A. Scott.Back in Washington, DC, Sarah Mudd obtained an audience with President Johnson and asked for a pardon for her husband, protesting that his guilt had not been established, that he was merely a treating physician and had no knowledge of the assassination at the time of the treatment, and was the victim of a military court that was \u201cout for blood.\u201d In truth, though he almost certainly was a conspirator in the original abduction plot, there was no evidence that Dr Mudd was aware of the assassination when Booth arrived at his house. Also, he provided the information to the authorities that Booth had come to his home and had given information as to the direction Booth was traveling. In addition, briefs and appeals were filed in the courts to protest the trial of civilian defendants by military tribunal as unconstitutional. Dr Mudd's health had been failing while he was chained in the dungeon, but improved after a communication from President Johnson relaxed his punishment. Dr Mudd initially had hospital duties when he arrived in July 1865, but lost them after his escape attempt and was working in the carpenter shop, until Sept 1867 when an epidemic of yellow fever struck the mosquito-laden island prison and claimed the life of the post commander and the post surgeon, Dr Joseph Sim Smith, who had been a classmate of Dr Mudd at Georgetown College, and who enlisted Dr Mudd's help during the epidemic.Mudd took over the hospital, inasmuch as he had some understanding of yellow fever because he had encountered it while in medical school during an 1855 epidemic. This was a frustrating disease, because the manner of contagion was unknown and treatment options were limited. Sam Arnold and Dr Mudd both contracted the disease, but survived, whereas Michael O'Laughlin died of it. Two hundred seventy of 300 people at Fort Jefferson contracted yellow fever, and 38 died. It was the feeling of the entire prison that Dr Mudd's skills, knowledge, courage, and willingness to treat these patients saved many lives. Of significance, he now had the run of the fort and was looked up to as a gentleman and a physician. A petition to President Johnson was signed by all, and Major Andrew Stone, the post commander was going to Washington to help in the effort to free Dr Mudd; however, Major Stone contracted the disease, and died in Key West, Florida. The new commander, Major George P. Andrews, had not suffered through the epidemic, and he put Dr Mudd and the other conspirators back into a cell, in chains. The guards, however, remained grateful to Dr Mudd for his efforts, and thanks to his medical skills and dedication, life was much better than before the epidemic.President Johnson had political problems of his own, having survived potential impeachment by only 1 vote, on May 26, 1868, but the next year, on Feb 13, 1869, he kept an old promise to Sarah Mudd and wrote an official pardon for Dr Mudd. Dr Mudd returned home in March 1869, and resumed his medical practice and farming. He and Sarah had 5 more children in addition to their previous 4. He ran for Maryland state legislature, but lost in the primary, and the nation that had previously pardoned him never really forgave him. The derogatory term \u201cYour name is Mudd\u201d became an accepted, widespread phrase, and he and his family were subjected to threats and verbal abuse for decades. Sam remained dedicated to his medical practice, but on New Year's Day 1883 he contracted pneumonia after making a house call on a cold, rainy night. He took to his bed, and died on Jan 10, 1883, and was buried at the same St Mary's Church Cemetery in Bryantown, Maryland, where he had first met John Wilkes Booth 19 years previously.Dr Mudd's family has never been satisfied with the unconditional pardon granted by President Johnson, and have been working for more than 130 years to exonerate the name Mudd. A 1936 biography entitledThe Prisoner of Shark Islandwon many friends for Sam Mudd and gave him American folk hero status. Numerous television productions about him have aired, a grade school was named after him, and in 1959 Congress established a memorial to him at Fort Jefferson. Presidents Jimmy Carter and Ronald Reagan wrote letters expressing their belief in Dr Mudd's innocence, but these were moral victories only. Finally, Senator Joseph Biden of Delaware asked the Secretary of the Army to reopen the Mudd case. A 5-member board of the Army Board for Correction of Military Records (ABCMR) was convened in 1992, and all 5 members agreed that Dr Mudd's trial had been a gross miscarriage of justice. The ABCMR concluded that the military commission that tried Dr Mudd did not have jurisdiction over civilians, and recommended that his conviction be set aside. The Assistant Secretary of the Army was William Clark, and he denied this recommendation on the basis that it is not the role of the ABCMR to attempt to settle historical disputes or to act as an appellate court. This was appealed, but 4 years later in 1996 the denial was upheld. In 1997 Congressman Hoyer of Maryland introduced a bill (HRR1985) in the House of Representatives to seek relief for Dr Mudd. When this bill stalled, the Mudd family filed a suit in the US District Court in 1998 and were successful in having the denial remanded back to the Secretary of the Army for review, but there has been no recent change in the status of this case, and as of this writing the family has never received any official notification from the Secretary of the Army exonerating the name Mudd.Now, what does all of this have to do with vascular surgery? Probably very little, but let's review some recent vascular history, and perhaps we will note some similarities or parallels.Denied on the basis of a \u201ctotality of criteria\u201d was the response received from Dr Stephen Miller, Secretary of the Liaison Committee for Specialty Boards (LCSB) on Dec 22, 2002, in response to a request from Drs James Stanley, Frank Veith, Robert Smith, and the Board of Directors of the American Board of Vascular Surgery (ABVS) asking for an accounting of the committee's decision to deny the application of the ABVS to become a new examining board in medical specialties.Since the early 1970s, prominent leaders in vascular surgery have strived for appropriate recognition of vascular surgery as a separate specialty. This issue has been ably addressed by several distinguished presidents of our most prestigious vascular societies, and began in Sept 1996 with incorporation of the ABVS to include the presidents, president elects, immediate past presidents, and secretaries of the Society for Vascular Surgery and the then current International Society for Cardiovascular Surgery, North American Chapter, 5 of which are current members of the Southern Association for Vascular Surgery (SAVS).This action was not viewed favorably by the American Board of Surgery (ABS), because vascular surgery was at that time deemed a primary component of general surgery training and the ABS leadership was not inclined to consider modifying the then current training regimen. They did, however, acknowledge the need for additional expertise in the construction of vascular examinations, determination of standards of certification, and oversight of the certification process. Accordingly, in 1998 the Vascular Surgery Board (VSB) of the ABS was created to help address these issues. The VSB-ABS consists of 2 directors of the ABS nominated respectively by the joint council of the vascular societies and the Association of Program Directors in Vascular Surgery (APDVS), and 3 additional members appointed respectively by the American Association for Vascular Surgery, the APDVS, and the Society for Vascular Surgery, each of whom serves for 3 years. An additional ad hoc member can be added by members of the board at the wish of the board. The current VSB-ABS board includes 3 members of the SAVS, Drs Bruce Gewertz, past President James Seegar, and Jonathan Towne. The immediate previous chair was our past president, Dr Pat Claggett. These 2 boards, the ABVS and the VSB of the ABS, share a common goal to maintain and continue to improve the quality of care available for patients with vascular disease. This care includes the broad spectrum of medical management, noninvasive and invasive diagnosis, open vascular reconstruction, endovascular procedures, and critical care.The issues are related to how best to train for and deliver these services.It is my belief that our colleagues and teachers in the 1970s\u2014Jack Wiley, Jessie Thompson, Sterling Edwards, James Deweese, our first SAVS President, John Foster, and others\u2014were already on the right track in trying to define vascular surgery as a distinct specialty.The ongoing efforts of the ABVS are correct in their intentions. In the interim between incorporation of the ABVS in 1996 and the present, dramatic changes have occurred across the spectrum of the treatment of vascular disease that make the issues even more relevant. Vascular surgeons have the best training and skills for evaluation and appropriate treatment of vascular disease. The recent technologic advances availing the improved diagnostic and endovascular treatment methods should become an integral part of every vascular surgeon's armamentarium and, more important, enjoy a major role in future vascular surgeon training. Herein lies the major conflict: how this can best be accomplished. Vascular training paradigms need to be altered to provide additional training for the expanded evaluation and treatment roles of endovascular therapies. Initial responses from the ABS and the Residency Review Committee for Surgery proposed an unacceptable training route, adding extra length to the current paradigm already considered by many as too long. This course was chosen to \u201cprotect\u201d the large role of vascular surgery within the realm of general surgery training. However, with time, changes in some of the previous ABS personnel, and of importance, with appropriate input from the VSB of the ABS, progress has been made. Specifically, recertification in general surgery by certified vascular surgeons was made optional. The Board no longer requires that general surgeons perform a specific number of aortic procedures. Two vascular surgeons were added to the Residency Review Committee for Surgery, and an additional vascular surgeon appointed by the APDVS was added to the ABS. An early specialization program has evolved that will enable chief resident rotations in surgery during the fourth clinical year, as well as 2 years of vascular training with the candidates eligible for dual certification. They would be eligible for general surgery certification after the fifth year, and vascular surgery certification after the sixth year.This is somewhat akin to the old joke, \u201cWhat do you call a busload of lawyers at the bottom of the ocean? A good start.\u201d Certainly, dual certification is an important, if not mandatory, concept for anyone who will need to practice or cross-cover call for general surgery patients. However, the new complexity of vascular surgery is such that a more desirable paradigm for many would be a 3 year plus 3-year program or possibly even later a 5-year vascular program, resulting in a fully trained vascular surgeon who does not desire to practice general surgery.The ABS previously changed vascular surgery from a \u201cprimary component\u201d to an \u201cessential content area\u201d of general surgery training, and there will likely be a continuation of the current national trend toward decreasing numbers of vascular surgery procedures being performed by general surgeons. Whether any or all of this can be accomplished under the auspices of the ABS remains to be seen. Certainly, it would be desirable to have the prestige and numbers of the spectrum of the ABS on our side, because as vascular surgeons we are few, whereas the physician groups with whom we will compete to provide vascular care in the future are many. Primary sticking points are the issues of certification standards and the potential creation of a Residency Review Committee for Vascular Surgery to evaluate and approve training programs as desired by the ABVS. The ABS has scheduled a retreat this month to discuss these important issues, as well as the American Board of Medical Specialties (ABMS) key issue of inability to grant board certification in a subspecialty without the applicant having certification from the primary board; that is, is a separate vascular surgery board mandatory to accomplish our goals?In 2002, the ABVS expanded its original board of directors to include representatives from 11of the remaining national and major regional professional organizations representing vascular surgery in North America. All 13 sponsoring organizations approved the now denied ABVS application that was submitted to the ABMS.This action had been approved in a 2001 independent poll of North American vascular surgeons conducted by DeLoite and Touche, which asked, \u201cShould vascular surgery seek an ABMS-approved independent specialty board at this time? Sixty-six percent of respondents answered yes, including 79% of those in practice less than 10 years.On June 18, 2003, Dr Jim Stanley filed a notice of appeal regarding the denial of the ABVS application to the ABMS. The language of this notice is strongly worded, and relates the ABVS frustration with the LCSB failure to communicate any definitive deficiencies in the completed massive application document. It delineates the grounds for appeal and expresses the desire for an appropriate open dialogue and forum with the ABMS to state the ABVS ideas and position on the issues. I was told by personal communication with SAVS past presidents Dr Robert Smith (Atlanta, Ga; Dec 2003) and Dr James C. Stanley (Ann Arbor, Mich; Dec 2003) that this appeal has been postponed pending information forthcoming from the scheduled ABS retreat. The intentions of the ABVS are well placed, and the members recognize the importance of working within and the potential \u201chazards\u201d of working outside the guidelines of the ABMS.The members of these two boards, the ABVS and the Vascular Board of the ABS, represent the best and the brightest of our specialty, and I am hopeful they will find the appropriate common ground that will enable our societies to act in a unified manner toward our common goal of providing the best possible training for the treatment of vascular disease.As for Quasimodo, in Victor Hugo'sHunchback of Notre DameI find many parallels with the beast we know as vascular surgery. On the surface, our specialty is not so \u201cglamorous\u201d as that of some of our colleagues. Often the persons in positions of authority, such as the LCSB, have been a little hard on us and made it difficult to achieve our goal as an independent board. To this point, we have been unable to garner much support from our colleagues on the ABS, and we may need to gather more positive public interest and support to aid our cause. The efforts of the ABVS have been worthwhile, as desperate times call for desperate measures, and someone must act to change the course of events.As vascular surgeons we are fortunate in that we love what we do. During many cases over the past 25 years, I have often told vascular fellows and residents that vascular surgery is to me what Notre Dame's bell, Big Marie, was to Quasimodo. It made him deaf, but he obviously enjoyed his work. My comment regarding vascular surgery is that \u201cI love her, but she is killing me.\u201dI have not mentioned the issues of limitations on residency training work hours or the problems related to access to training opportunities for continued development of endovascular skills, but these issues are critical components of our current training program dilemma.It appears that the leaders in our specialty are making significant progress in attaining our goal of, if not complete independence, at least control over the credentialing, training, and recognition of expertise required for vascular certification in the future.Like Sam Mudd, if we persevere in using our skills and dedication we may gain appropriate government support to gain our freedom and continue our practice. Or, like Quasimodo, we may have to be a bit more forceful and take matters into our own hands to achieve our goal. Either will require a unified effort from all concerned, and I urge each of you to stay abreast of these issues as they evolve, and be ready and willing to contribute time and resources to aid our vascular surgery leaders.I thank you for the honor of serving as your president this year and for the opportunity of speaking to you today.",
  "2004": "I am honored to stand before you as the 58th president of the Society for Vascular Surgery (SVS). I do so with a sense of gratitude and pride. I wish to thank and acknowledge each of you who worked so hard to energize our society. We have moved to Chicago, and our national headquarters is fully operational. The already obvious efficiencies validate the merger and the move. The seamless, yet rapid, transition is testimony to Becky Maron's effectiveness as our Executive Director.A glimpse of reality in 2004We are a special group, perhaps the ultimate multi-taskers. Imagine the skill set of a single individual able to repair a thoracoabdominal aneurysm, recanalize an occluded superficial femoral artery percutaneously, and treat a deep venous thrombosis, all in the same day. All of these skills are reflected in this exciting program in which investigators from all over the world are gathered to exchange information. But something is wrong. The enthusiasm at this meeting is created in a too small number of programs, and we are having trouble selling our message.The unfilled positions in the vascular match are shown in. For the 10 years between 1992 and 2002, somewhere between 0 and 6 positions were unmatched annually. This year 23 positions were unmatched. While the overall number of positions has increased, the applicant pool has decreased in quantity and quality. In 1995 72 positions were offered in 62 programs, and 95 of the 110 applicants were graduates of US medical schools. This last year 110 positions were offered in 90 programs, and 82 of the 112 applicants were graduates of US medical schools (National Resident Matching Program data, available at:). The trends are ominous.When things go poorly there must be villains. Let's not blame other specialties, the length of our training, Generation X, or the high proportion of women in medical school. Let's put the blame where it belongs; blame our content.My perspective comes from 3 distinct experiences, as an officer of SVS, as a former program director, and as a practicing vascular surgeon. My heritage is the vascular room at Strong Memorial Hospital, with Drs Charles Rob and Jim DeWeese as my mentors. I recently left these comfortable confines, with its deep tradition of vascular surgery excellence, to accept the challenge of building a vascular institute at Lenox Hill Hospital, an institution with an equally deep tradition of cardiology dominance. With that pedigree I believe I can speak credibly about the world we live in.My theme comes from the book of Ecclesiastes. Attributed to King Solomon, it was directed at the ancient Judeans who were looking to survive in a world dominated by Greek rule. The Judeans had lost their sense of optimism, and Solomon recognized that there were but two options: act in the face of adversity or fade away. Ecclesiastes 2:24, \u201cA live dog is better than a dead lion,\u201d has as much relevance for contemporary vascular surgeons as it did for those ancient Judeans.We must resolve 2 critical problems related to content. The first is our status as a sub-specialty of general surgery, and the second is the anticipated introduction of carotid stenting into clinical practice. Sub-specialty status affects the content of what we teach and therefore our ability to recruit and properly train a workforce capable of providing care at a level consistent with our heritage. The clinical launch of carotid stenting affects the content of what we do, and introduces a treatment option unfamiliar and unavailable to most vascular surgeons in one of our defining areas. Even worse, we face a crisis over our legitimacy as vascular care providers, and, sadly, our ability to effect meaningful change is limited.The founding members of SVS were the ancient Greeks of surgery, those high political powers with academic, medical, and social influence. They were free to innovate at their own leisurely pace, and the only scrutiny on their activities was self-imposed. They came from New Orleans, Harvard, and Johns Hopkins. It was their preeminence that drew many of us into the field. They succeeded because they were innovative, daring, and good. Norman Hertzer was absolutely correct in his SVS presidential address in 1994: results mean everything.Or so we thought. Now, in a little more than 50 years, despite our good results we have become more like the Judeans than our Greek ancestors, a distinct minority in a world where we were once masters. Recent industry estimates indicate that less than 15% of the 7000 physicians who perform percutaneous vascular interventions in the United States are vascular surgeons.Minority status is not just a function of numbers, however; it is also a reflection of society, and ours readily accepts new technologies, not because of their superiority, but because something in the balance of risk, cost, and performance meets a social or consumer need. Those of you experiencing minority status for the first time may find it uncomfortable. You are not used to scrutiny from outsiders, and react poorly and defensively when what you do is challenged.The crisis of content: What we teachMy support for an independent board of vascular surgery was always predicated on a need to radically change the way we train our fellows. While I understand that there are other issues, boards are responsible for training and certification. Until now, the only mechanism possible under the American Board of Medical Specialties rules to expand vascular education and reduce the nonessential elements of general surgery was an independent board for vascular surgery. What is the likelihood that a small group such as ours can succeed in this quest? A steel-willed central authority holds the advantage against any uprising.To preserve its rights it is sometimes necessary for a minority to confront power. Dr Martin Luther King, in response to critics of his tactics, wrote the following from a jail cell in Birmingham, Alabama, in 1963:Non-violent direct action seeks to create such a crisis and establish such creative tension that a community that has constantly refused to negotiate is forced to confront the issue. It seeks to dramatize the issue so that it can no longer be ignored\u2026we have not made a single gain in civil rights without determined legal and nonviolent pressure. History is a long and tragic story of the fact that privileged groups seldom give up their privileges voluntarily\u2026 .Our \u201ccreative tension\u201d was orchestrated through the activities of the American Board of Vascular Surgery (ABVS) with the support of this society. Vascular surgery tried to secure its rightful place when in 1996 our leadership decided to establish a Primary Specialty Board of Vascular Surgery. The decision to move in this direction was supported by the vast majority of vascular surgeons in the United States. While a number of positive American Board of Surgery (ABS) actions dealt with symptoms of our past concerns, none addressed the fundamental issues regarding flexibility in our training programs. Serious attempts at resolving these more difficult matters by several of my predecessors, notably, Drs Hobson and Berguer, were rebuffed in less than gracious style. While the arguments for independence were compelling, the outcome was not surprising when viewed in the context of minority group survival.The number 1 priority of the September 2003 SVS Critical Initiatives Retreat was to reopen communications with the ABS to determine whether progress might be made with regard to a radical change in the vascular surgical training paradigms. Although there was reaffirmation of support for the ABVS, there was pessimism that a timely solution could be achieved. Dr Jack Cronenwett and I met with Drs Frank Lewis and Ron Meier during the American College of Surgeons meeting in Chicago last October, along with Drs Frank Logerfo and John Ricotta representing the Vascular Surgery Board. At that meeting we were told that the ABS would consider moving vascular surgery to primary certification status if a change in training was indeed our primary goal. As a consequence, the design and control of vascular surgical training would be at the discretion of vascular surgeons, and general surgical certification would no longer be required for those who limit their practice to vascular surgery. As a sign of good faith, Dr Lewis requested that I ask the ABVS to defer its appeal of the adverse Liaison Committee for Specialty Boards decision. These issues were taken back to the SVS council, where there was unanimous support for moving forward. In addition, the ABVS agreed to defer its appeal.Later on in the fall an expanded and representative group of vascular educators met in New York City to discuss the initiative. There was consensus for a proposal to make vascular training similar to plastic surgical training, with a variety of options including one with dual certification and one with single certification beginning directly after medical school. A final meeting was held in Philadelphia, with Jim Stanley representing the ABVS and Barbara Bass representing the ABS, in which the outline of the proposal that would be presented to the ABS directors in January was discussed. A subsequent meeting of ABVS directors that evening decided not to support the primary certificate, but the SVS Executive Committee agreed to proceed.The proposal negotiated with the ABS to move vascular surgery to primary certificate designation was unanimously approved by the ABS directors. An application was written jointly by representatives of the ABS and SVS, and was submitted to the American Board of Medical Specialties in March 2004. Approval is anticipated in March 2005. A paragraph from the preamble summarizes the effort:[T]o\u2026move to a paradigm in which vascular surgery training is independent of general surgical training requires that the vascular surgery certificate move from subspecialty to primary status. This is the purpose of this application. It is anticipated that the transition in training will be gradual, and dual training pathways will be maintained for the foreseeable future, such that existing approved pathways will continue for those seeking certification in both general surgery and vascular surgery while new training pathways for those seeking training only in vascular surgery will be created. A model similar to that currently in place for plastic surgery is envisioned, such that medical school graduates may match directly into vascular surgery residencies, or may choose to complete general surgical training before entering vascular surgery.The efforts of the ABVS, although sometimes more aggressive than some might like, provided the impetus that in large part moved the ABS, at last, to confront the issue of primary certification for vascular surgery. This did not occur in a vacuum, however, because a group that I referred to in 1997 as \u201carrogant and out of touch, non-reactive to changing realities,\u201dis younger, more specialized and trying to accommodate change in the entirety of surgery. I have absolutely no reservations about the sincerity of the ABS directors at this time, and their desire to give vascular surgery the independence necessary while remaining a partner in those areas of mutual interest.We have achieved in the recent negotiations almost everything we asked for. I know that there are unresolved issues, in particular surrounding the construct of the Residency Review Committee, and those will be dealt with as the process evolves. It is now time to accept this victory, to recognize the accomplishments of Drs Ramon Berguer, Bob Hobson, Jim Stanley, Frank Veith, and many others (and that list is in alphabetic order), whose vision and perseverance have brought us to this threshold, and to move quickly to full implementation of our own primary certificate. And I emphasize the word quickly, or an anticipated void will be filled by those specialties able to provide a competent workforce.To those who say that this is at best a temporary solution, and at worst a classic Faustian bargain, I say, you may be right, but it is a risk we must take. In my opinion, the ABS has gone as far as it can go at this time, and our ultimate relationship will not be determined by further political pressure, but by evolution of our specialty. If we continue to perform intra-abdominal procedures, this solution will work and may actually be preferable to a stand-alone scenario, because we will have assurance that our trainees will get preferential rotations in general surgery. If the balance continues to shift in the direction of the angiography suite, our relationship will be of historic interest only. We have not reached that point, although I believe that we will.To those who believe this is not what we set out to achieve, I disagree. Internal conflict represents the abyss of any minority condition; at best it is a nuisance, at worst it is fatal. To the extent that we encumber our young with our old battles, we fail. This has become an old battle. A live dog, vascular surgery that designs and controls the content of its training programs, is better than a dying specialty, once king of the jungle but now unable to replenish its food chain.The crisis of content: What we doOur second critical challenge is to involve vascular surgeons in carotid stenting. This is all about the content of what we do. The segue to percutaneous therapy for a condition that once defined our specialty is a painful but necessary one for us if we are to maintain our legitimacy, and there is no better way to claim legitimacy than to demonstrate competence. On the eve of the clinical launch of carotid stenting there are an insufficient number of vascular surgeons who can make that claim.It became very clear to me several years ago that our participation in carotid stenting programs on a grand scale would be contingent on our public acceptance of the procedure for limited indications. We were appropriately considered hypocritical when some vascular surgeons with percutaneous expertise asked industry for access to devices and our official position remained unsupportive. How could we ask to be trained in private for a procedure we criticized in public? We could not, and have any credibility.We chose not only to support a Current Procedural Terminology code and a request to remove the national non-coverage policy, but we offered Dr Robert Zwolak, unquestionably one of the most effective physicians in the area of government activity, regardless of specialty, to write the proposals. More recently we spoke on behalf of approval for the Precise Stent/AngioGuard Cerebral Protection System (Cordis Endovascular) at the recent Food and Drug Administration Advisory Panel meeting. While we may not be able to preserve carotid endarterectomy on a pre-2004 scale, we have ensured the opportunity for vascular surgeons with percutaneous expertise to treat carotid bifurcation stenosis. Once again we chose the live dog over the dead lion, but this battle is not over.Vascular surgeons may well possess the skill, the knowledge, and the patient volume to perform carotid stenting, but they must also have credentials. The elements of carotid stenting are listed in the. The endocompetent vascular surgeon has all the requisite skills, and should only require training for using the embolic filter device. It is unfortunate that there is no consensus on the fundamental question as to who is qualified to perform carotid stenting. The ability to provide periprocedural care and knowledge about the risk factors for atherosclerosis are matters of great importance, and should be at the top of the list. I am amazed that anyone is paying serious attention to the totally wrong but well-formulated radiology position that states that the essence of this procedure is experience with a dangerous diagnostic procedure and dismisses any other interventional experience as irrelevant.The radiologists have carefully analyzed the risk factors for cerebral angiography, and without question have shown that this is a dangerous procedure and that practice makes one a better angiographer.We recognized this a long time ago, and have abandoned it as routine before carotid endarterectomy.At Lenox Hill Hospital, with experience approaching 1000 carotid stenting procedures, we see no need for routine arch and 4-vessel diagnostic angiography, and use duplex scanning, magnetic resonance angiography, and single-vessel angiography. These methods provide sufficient information that the performance of efficacious carotid stenting, with embolic filter devices, may be undertaken without the unnecessary trauma to the aortic arch and its branches from repetitive catheter manipulations. Any attempt to mandate a fixed number of unnecessary and dangerous diagnostic tests to learn a procedure that is intended to reduce the incidence of stroke will have the exact opposite effect, regardless of the specialty of the trainee.While vascular surgery has been supportive of Food and Drug Administration and Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services approval of carotid stenting, we have done so with certain provisos.We believe that the inclusion criteria should be divided into anatomic and medical criteria. Anatomic criteria would include patients with significant carotid stenosis and contralateral carotid occlusion, contralateral laryngeal nerve palsy, radiation therapy to the neck, or previous carotid endarterectomy with recurrent stenosis. The medical criteria are more difficult to define, because the degree of risk from carotid endarterectomy is significantly affected by the team performing the operation. Variable institutional results should affect patient selection for stenting. Collaboration between the interventionalist and the surgeon who performs carotid endarterectomy, unless it is the same person, must occur to reach institutional consensus on high risk.In the attempt to obtain credentials we must never lose sight of the quality of care that we have always been associated with. It is what has distinguished us from others performing vascular procedures, and we cannot let patient safety suffer. This means that we need to consider seriously what credentialing document we put forward. It needs to be responsible, it needs to be realistic, and it may mean, for a time, that some vascular surgeons will not be able to do this procedure.I believe that the criteria adopted by the Carotid Revascularization and Endarterectomy vs Stent Trial (CREST) Interventional Management Committee are a reasonable starting point for credentialing committees. These criteria have been vetted and corroborated by the excellent results of the CREST lead-in phase.It is interesting that there are no specific diagnostic cerebral angiography requirements (Personal communication [oral], Dr Gary Roubin, Chairman, CREST Interventional Committee, May 17, 2004). Previous percutaneous interventional expertise is required as a starting point, and hospital procedure notes and discharge summaries for 30 consecutive patients undergoing carotid stenting must be submitted. Those eligible would be interventionalists with percutaneous expertise, defined as someone with experience in guiding catheters, self-expandable stents, 0.014-inch wire systems, and rapid exchange devices. The CREST experience demonstrates that cardiologists and vascular surgeons with expertise in percutaneous peripheral interventions can learn carotid stenting and angioplasty, and do it well. This is a set of guidelines that all credentialing bodies should follow, because it is the only one that has been validated with outcomes.Is there any good news?Vascular surgeons, despite their minority status, perform one third of the endovascular procedures in the United States. If one looks at device industry estimates for 2004 and considers which of the areas represent opportunities for continued growth on the basis of improved technology and increased numbers of capable physicians, the 3 markets in which experts predict the greatest growth are aortic aneurysm treatment, superior femoral artery recanalization, and carotid artery stenting (). Internal industry data clearly document that once a vascular surgeon develops comfort and expertise with percutaneous procedures, on average the surgeon's use of peripheral devices exceeds that of both radiologists and cardiologists. How else could fewer than 15% of practitioners perform 35% of procedures?Why, then, can't we sell our specialty? If endocompetent, we are the only providers who can offer patients a variety of treatment options. We currently have dominant positions in the three areas with the largest growth potential over the next generation. We have established referral networks, and we have credibility as physicians.In 2003 a device company commissioned a survey to look at endovascular competence in 3 groups of physicians: vascular surgeons, interventional radiologists, and interventional cardiologists. As expected, the range of expertise varied among the groups, but the most striking difference was in the response to the question about patient surveillance after the procedure, where vascular surgeons were clearly superior (). If we have any claim for legitimacy it is because of our commitment to the patient before, during, and after an intervention.My suggestionsWe must recognize and accept that we are not the controlling majority of those who treat vascular disease or govern surgery. Rather than pretend otherwise, we must take advantage of our limited resources and opportunities without delay. All we need, with all of our talents, is a chance: a chance to define our own training as we think best, and a chance to continue to care for a segment of patients we understand better than any other group. Let's grab them, because a live dog is indeed better than a dead lion.Of course, not any dog will do. We cannot assume the couch position and simmer in our ennui, waiting for our master to come home from work. We must assume the feisty attitude of the terrier, not the biggest, not the strongest, but the most determined. We owe nothing less to our patients and our heritage.As for me, I know that King Solomon did not spend all of his time ruminating about dead lions. As I leave this podium in my penultimate act as president of the SVS and return to New York, I plan on following another edict in Ecclesiastes: \u201cThere is nothing better for mortals than to eat and drink and find enjoyment in their work.\u201dThank you for your support and for the opportunity and honor to serve as your president. Good luck.",
  "2005": "I am honored to stand before you as the 59thpresident of the Society for Vascular Surgery (SVS). It has been a privilege to serve as your president during a time marked by great change and significant progress, both in our field and for our society.Vascular surgery in the year 2005 is at a crossroads. Trends in demographics, workforce, technology, public opinion, and public policy will lead to more accountability and to greater autonomy at the same time. Vascular surgeons, like all physicians, will be increasingly accountable to patients, payers, and policy makers. But we will also enjoy a new level of autonomy to control our destiny as a specialty and to direct the educational paths of the generations who follow us. A new chapter in the history of vascular surgery is about to be written.Demographic trends and workforce challengesFirst, let us consider demographics. As a nation, we are growing older. The leading edge of the Baby Boomers, including some in this room, will turn 60 next year. In 2003, one in every eight Americans was over the age of 65.By 2030, one in every five of us will qualify for Medicare. Meanwhile, a growing number of Americans of all ages are being diagnosed with diabetes\u2014one every 25 seconds. That translates to more than 1.3 million adults diagnosed in 2003. From 1997 through 2003, the number of new cases of diagnosed diabetes increased by 52%.Results from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey showed a 14.5% prevalence of peripheral arterial disease in patients 70 years or older.Every year, about 82,000 diabetic patients have leg, foot, or toe amputations. More than 80% of those amputations are preventable\u2014and every day, vascular surgeons are working to prevent them.The aging population and the diabetes epidemic portend tremendous growth in the need for vascular surgeons\u2014a need that we will find increasingly difficult to meet, unless we make significant changes now. To meet demand projections for the year 2030, we should be graduating 160 vascular surgery residents every year.The actual number of graduates falls far short of the need. In 2005, 121 candidates took the vascular surgery certifying examination.The numbers are not expected to be very different in 2006.This shortfall in manpower is both chronic and cumulative. Recruiting more medical students and residents to our field is a matter of the highest priority. In recognition of that need, SVS, under the leadership of Dr Julie Freischlag and the Education Council, has awarded scholarships to 63 general surgery residents and 23 medical students, enabling them to attend the Vascular Annual Meeting.Filling the pipeline has been at the top of the SVS agenda for several years. My esteemed predecessor, Dr Richard Green, spoke to this issue from this podium in Anaheim, California last year. He described the number of unfilled positions in the vascular match as an ominous trend.In 2003, Dr Tony Sidawy addressed this topic in his capacity as president of the Eastern Vascular Society.This year, I am pleased to report, we have reason for optimism. The road to a career in vascular surgery has just become a direct route. In March 2005, the American Board of Medical Specialties approved a primary certificate in vascular surgery, effectively eliminating the requirement for residents to obtain board certification in general surgery before beginning their vascular surgery training. That requirement had been in effect since 1982. The American Board of Surgery describes the primary certificate as a \u201clandmark decision that will alter the landscape of surgical training and certification in the United States.\u201dMany of us experienced the months leading up to the approval of the primary certificate as a difficult time. Some of our colleagues voiced concerns that the primary certificate was not the best long-term strategy, that it would hinder our movement toward independence and autonomy. Opinions were expressed in strong terms on both sides of this issue. As we seek ways to make common cause, to come together as a community with a shared goal, we would do well to remember the words of the great statesman Thomas Jefferson at his first inaugural address in 1801:\u201cEvery difference of opinion is not a difference of principle. We have called by different names brethren of the same principle. We are all republicans, we are all federalists.\u201dJefferson\u2019s words resonate with us today. Reasonable minds may differ on tactics although our ultimate goals are the same. We must move forward knowing that the forces that unite us are stronger than those that would divide us. The need to provide for our professional progeny is a powerful uniting force.The more flexible and in-depth educational tracks made possible by the primary certificate will serve as a catalyst for growth in the number of vascular surgery trainees. By reducing the time spent in general surgery rotations, the primary certificate will result in a shortened training period for junior residents or medical students who choose vascular surgery early on. It will bring more freedom of career choice to medical students and residents, who will be able to make the vascular surgery choice at various stages of training\u2013during medical school, after several years of initial surgical training, or after completion of full general surgery training. And precious curriculum hours will become available for training in open and endovascular techniques as well as in areas such as nonoperative prevention, diagnosis, and management of vascular disease.The new training models made possible by the primary certificate include a 6-year track (\u201c3 + 3\u201d) for residents who match in initial surgical training, and a 5-year integrated track for trainees who match during medical school. The Association for Program Directors in Vascular Surgery (APDVS), under the leadership of Dr Jim Seeger, is currently working to define the curricula necessary for both of the new models. Our thanks go to the APDVS for the work they have done to bring us to this point and for the ongoing work involved in this major curriculum redevelopment.The impact of endovascular technologiesIn addition to contending with the workforce challenges that arise from demographic trends, we must also address the impact of changing surgical technologies\u2014specifically, the impact of endovascular surgery. Carotid endarterectomy (CEA) is still the most frequently performed surgical procedure to prevent stroke in this country. In recent years, carotid artery angioplasty and stenting have emerged as an alternative to CEA. In March of this year, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services expanded Medicare coverage beyond trial settings for carotid angioplasty and carotid artery stenting in symptomatic patients at high risk for endarterectomy.Treatment for abdominal aortic aneurysm is also undergoing a major shift, perhaps the most significant in its history. In recently published findings, the United Kingdom\u2019s EndoVascular Aneurysm Repair (EVAR) Trial, led by Dr Roger Greenhalghand the Dutch Randomized Endovascular Aneurysm Management (DREAM) Trial, led by Dr Jan Blankensteijn,reported that endovascular treatment of abdominal aortic aneurysm is associated with lower rates of 30-day mortality compared with open repair. The DREAM team has recently published the results of their mid-term follow-up, and at 1 and 2 years, they found that the initial 30-day survival advantage of endovascular aneurysm repair over open surgery is no longer evident, apparently due to an excess of nonaneurysm-related cardiovascular mortality.In a session to be presented later at this meeting, Dr Roger Greenhalgh will present the 1-year results of the United Kingdom randomized trial.In a study presented earlier at this meeting, Dillavou, Muluk, and Makaroundiscussed the effects of the introduction of endovascular aneurysm repair in the United States. Their conclusions: endovascular aneurysm repair is replacing open surgery without an overall increase in case volume. The proportion of patients treated with endovascular repair increased from about 6% in 2000 to 41% in 2003. At the same time, they found that operative mortality was lower for patients who underwent endovascular repair, replicating the initial United Kingdom and Dutch randomized studies on perioperative mortality. Moreover, patients treated with endovascular repair were discharged from the hospital sooner and were more likely to go home rather than to skilled nursing facilities.There is little doubt that endovascular technologies will fundamentally change the vascular surgery landscape and that we must be prepared to navigate this new terrain. The impact of endovascular technologies on patient outcomes and practice patterns will be lasting and far-reaching. We must provide educational support for endovascular procedures to both practicing and aspiring vascular surgeons.SVS research, under the guidance of Drs Richard Cambria and Craig Kent, has documented that only 31% of 774 practicing vascular surgeons who responded to a survey, received endovascular training in their fellowships (Society for Vascular Surgery Endovascular Training Opportunities Project, unpublished data, Chicago, Ill, 2005). About 60% have taken postfellowship training in endovascular procedures, the majority consisting of 1- to 5-day training programs such as the carotid arteriography and stenting courses initiated by the SVS in December 2004 and repeated in April 2005. The SVS Endovascular Committee, under the leadership of Drs Kim Hodgson and Peter Schneider, is planning to hold additional carotid, aneurysm and peripheral intervention courses in 2005. The Endovascular Training Opportunities Committee is in the process of developing an online endovascular training opportunities clearinghouse to provide information about mini-fellowships and industry-organized short courses throughout the country.Growing consumer awareness of vascular surgeryThe availability of \u201ckinder, gentler\u201d less-invasive endovascular procedures has raised public awareness of vascular surgery. I am happy to report that the era of vascular surgery as the best-kept secret in American medicine is coming to an end. People are starting to know who we are.Consumers, a group that is all-inclusive and not limited to patients, are starting to realize that \u201cit\u2019s not just about their coronary arteries anymore.\u201d This change is happening at the community level, as more hospitals promote vascular wellness and conduct free vascular screenings. Our own American Vascular Association (AVA) has screened more people than ever this year, coordinating the efforts of more than 175 screening centers throughout the country that participated in Vascular Health Month in May 2005. This culminated in the single largest vascular screening the AVA has ever conducted, in which nearly 300 individuals were screened at the Hyatt Regency Chicago on June 14. On behalf of all society members and the SVS board, our thanks go to the 30-plus individuals, including SVS members who volunteered for this screening and to Dr Bill Flinn and screening program administrator Michele Lentz, who have worked very hard to put programs like these together.AVA screening program results consistently show that about 10% of individuals who are screened are referred to their physicians for additional vascular diagnostic testing. All individuals screened are encouraged to take their Vascular Report Card results to their primary care physicians. And all leave with a better understanding of the signs and symptoms of vascular disease.Not only is vascular disease awareness increasing in communities throughout the country, it is increasing in the virtual community as well. We are now reaching thousands of consumers through the patient education section of our Website, VascularWeb. This year, through a partnership with content development specialists at NorthPoint Domain, we have added 35 topics related to vascular conditions, tests, and treatments. Traffic began increasing almost immediately, thanks to citations by major Internet search engines and megasites such as Medline Plus, the online patient health resource provided by the National Library of Medicine and the National Institutes of Health.Since the relaunch of the redesigned VascularWeb in 2004, the number of people using the site has increased steadily and is now at about 3000 per day. Much of this increase is because VascularWeb has become a leading patient education resource for vascular disease. With an estimated 95 million American adults now searching for health information online,VascularWeb goes a long way toward increasing awareness and understanding of vascular disease. We appreciate the dedication and diligence of Dr Wayne Johnston and Karen Thomas, who have overseen the development of the patient information section and the relaunch of the entire Website.Public policy changes that support vascular surgeryRecognition of the impact of vascular disease is happening at the public policy level as well. This year marked the release of new US Preventive Services Task Force recommendations on screening for abdominal aortic aneurysms.The task force\u2019s previous recommendations, issued in 1996, did not find evidence to support screening in any population. The new task force report supports screening for men older than 65 years with a history of smoking. We are very pleased about the progress this represents: the new recommendations capture an estimated 70% of the men in this age group. The Preventive Services Task Force recommendations are widely viewed as the gold standard for good quality scientific evidence of effectiveness. Furthermore, the task force recommendations serve as the basis for benefits and coverage policies by many commercial insurers and third-party payers.But the society will not stop here in its efforts to broaden coverage for aneurysm screening. Discussions between the National Aneurysm Alliance and the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality on this issue are ongoing. Meanwhile, the Screening Abdominal Aortic Aneurysms Very Efficiently (SAAAVE) Act (HR 827/S.390), which was introduced in February 2005 by bipartisan sponsors, would provide an ultrasound screening benefit for at-risk Medicare beneficiaries, including men and women with a positive family history for aneurysms as well as those with established medical risk factors. This legislation is supported by the National Aneurysm Alliance, a broad coalition founded by the SVS that includes medical professional organizations, foundations, patient advocates, and medical technology manufacturers. Our sincere thanks go to Dr Bob Zwolak, who is leading the National Aneurysm Alliance effort to make this happen.Outcomes assessment in vascular surgeryThe new higher profile for vascular surgery comes at a time when every sector of American medicine is under the microscope. Patient safety, quality improvement, and outcomes reporting are at the top of everyone\u2019s agenda.Norman Hertzer predicted this trend back in 1994 during his tenure as president of the society. The title of his presidential address said it all:Outcomes Assessment in Vascular Surgery\u2013Results Mean Everything.Dr Hertzer went on to say:If we can distance ourselves for a moment from the daily confusion regarding healthcare and how to finance it, the present debate about quality and cost offers an unmistakable opportunity for us to make vascular surgery better than it ever has been. We just have to get back to the fundamentals. What do we really stand for as surgeons? I think we stand for results. Hospitals should know their own results, and surgeons must be among the first, not the last, to insist on it. For nearly 50 years, [our society] has conducted a proud and principled search for excellence in vascular surgery. These are uncertain times, but we cannot stop now.The trend toward outcomes reporting is being driven by increasing public demands for accountability and the move toward \u201cpay for performance\u201d (P4P) among other factors. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) is working toward implementation of P4P in all health-care settings. The first P4P demonstration project for physician groups became operational in April of this year. Meanwhile, nearly 300 hospitals are participating in a CMS demonstration project involving 34 quality measures related to five clinical conditions. These hospitals receive financial incentives for high quality, while institution-specific performance data are reported on CMS Website. And this is just the beginning.After years of development on many fronts, there is finally a risk-adjusted, outcomes-based program to measure and improve the quality of surgical care\u2014the National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (NSQIP)\u2014sponsored by the American College of Surgeons. NSQIP uses a prospective, peer-controlled, validated database to quantify 30-day, risk-adjusted surgical outcomes, allowing for valid comparison of outcomes among all hospitals in the program. When NSQIP was launched more than 20 years ago, risk-adjusted surgical outcomes and national averages did not exist. In response to Veterans Affairs (VA) institutions coming under intense public scrutiny over the quality of their surgical care, a 1986 congressional law was passed mandating that the VA report its surgical outcomes every year. NSQIP was launched in January 1994 as a program that analyzes surgical data in VA institutions using risk-adjusted methodology to facilitate reporting of their outcomes on an annual basis. Subsequently, from 1991 to 2001, the VA saw a 27% decline in postoperative mortality, a 45% drop in postoperative morbidity, a decline in the median postoperative length of stay from 9 days to 4 days, and improvements in patient satisfaction.During the early VA years, NSQIP developed and validated risk-adjustment models, using stepwise forward logistical regression to identify the preoperative risk factors that were predictive of outcomes. The concept is simple: it is based on observed vs expected (O/E) ratios of surgical outcomes. NSQIP suggests thinking of the O/E ratio as a par on a golf course\u2014the score that is expected. An O/E ratio of less than 1 means better-than-expected performance; a ratio of more than 1 indicates an excess of adverse events. The ratios show that risk adjustment has a profound effect in determining a hospital\u2019s true performance.Recognizing the success of the VA-NSQIP program, the American College of Surgeons (ACS) adopted its methodology to collect and analyze data in nonfederal institutions in what was termed the AC-NSQIP. In 1999, a pilot study that included only general surgery and vascular surgery was launched to determine the feasibility of implementing NSQIP outside of the VA. Would the risk-adjustment model used in the VA system hold true for the more heterogeneous private sector? After 1 year, the results were conclusive: the NSQIP system worked. Based on the success of that study, the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality approved funding for an application by ACS to expand the pilot program to 14 additional medical centers, including the institution where I work in St Louis. In 2002, the Institute of Medicine named NSQIP \u201cthe best in the nation\u201d for measuring and reporting surgical quality and outcomes. The SVS and the AVA have begun discussions with ACS about modifying existing NSQIP protocols to permit collection of data on long-term outcomes of CAS compared with CEA. A program is anticipated for rollout in late 2005 or early 2006.We look forward to the implementation of the NSQIP program in vascular surgery. At the same time, we realize that the CMS mandate for CAS facilities to collect outcomes data means that vascular surgeons must have an outcomes data collectionnow,not next year. To meet this need, I have appointed an AVA/SVS Outcomes Steering Committee that will help guide us as we move forward in this arena. Our first major initiative is the AVA/SVS Vascular Registry, which will permit easy, straightforward collection of both carotid endarterectomy and stent procedure data.In addition to meeting CMS regulations for payment of CAS, this Web-based registry will provide individual surgeons with confidential benchmarking reports and will give hospitals a downloadable database of all carotid procedures performed at their institutions. All SVS members are encouraged to take advantage of the opportunity to participate in the first carotid registry in the market. Wide participation by vascular surgeons in these outcomes initiatives will allow regulatory agencies, researchers, practitioners, and industry to gain insight into the most appropriate indications and patient populations for carotid interventions. The success of the AVA/SVS Registry is important in establishing outcomes mechanisms that should be expanded to other anatomic sectors.Like it or not, we are practicing vascular surgery during a time when innovation is leading to transformation.You have probably heard a saying that is often attributed to the ancient Chinese: \u201cMay you live in interesting times.\u201d Although it is usually described as a curse, it may also be viewed as a blessing. Vascular surgery is an exciting specialty with a bright future, despite all the challenges we face today\u2014indeed, partly because of them. We must accept public accountability and embrace professional autonomy, always mindful of the privileges and responsibilities inherent in both. And we must move forward as one community with a single voice and a shared vision for the benefit of our fellow vascular surgeons, and above all, for the benefit of our patients.I thank all of you for your support. It has been an honor and privilege to serve as your president. I will never forget this extraordinary experience.",
  "2006": "Thank you for allowing me to serve as your president this past year. It is an honor I never dreamed of as a young man in Brazil.Coming to America for specialized training was already a dream come true for me. I knew where the best medicine on the planet was being taught and practiced. I soon realized that this country offered a unique opportunity for any committed surgeon to develop an exciting academic career and a strong clinical practice. The medical landscape in the United States has always been fair, motivating, and indeed rewarding to foreigners and Americans alike.Here I had the privilege and the good fortune of being mentored by two of the most prolific contributors to vascular surgery: Frank Veith and Henry Haimovici. Each of them added significantly to my career, and I will always cherish the very special time I spent with them.This has been an exciting year, not only for me as your president, but also for our society. Today I would like to share with you some of my thoughts about the direction vascular surgery should take to remain competitive. I will highlight the value of speaking with one voice, and I will briefly describe the new SVS structure. It is fitting that as we celebrate our 60th anniversary, we consider changes that will make our society stronger and our members more competitive.The Primary Certificate in vascular surgerySpeaking of where we fit, just a few months ago, the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education approved the Primary Certificate in vascular surgery. The Primary Certificate means that applicants for vascular surgery fellowships will now enjoy several training paradigms, including a shortened 5-year program straight from medical school!It also means we are going to be able to attract more women and minorities. This diversity is going to be good for our profession and make us more reflective of the patients we take care of. Moreover, graduates will no longer have to sit for boards in a specialty that they may never practice. The Primary Certificate was a project idealized and nurtured by the SVS leadership over the last 3 years.I take this opportunity to thank all the members of the American Board of Surgery and the Vascular Surgery Board for their unanimous vote of confidence. Without their support, it would have been impossible to report to you today this accomplishment for vascular surgery. Also, let us not forget the contribution of Dr Edwin Wyley, who in 1970 used his presidential address to the International Society for Cardiovascular Surgery membership to call for the creation of vascular fellowships and vascular board certification.Let us not forget Dr James DeWeese, who 34 years ago spearheaded a committee from the American Heart Association to investigate the practice of vascular surgery nationwide and its impact on surgical residencies. That was the true beginning of a long journey towards recognition of vascular surgery as a mature and independent specialty.The American Board of Vascular SurgeryNow we need to think progressively and start planning for the future. The goal of complete independence for vascular surgery needs to be rekindled and negotiated, ideally with the support of the American Board of Surgery.The rapid growth of endovascular therapy seen over the last two decades has cemented the fact that we are indeed a specialty distinct from general surgery. Historically, we originated from a select, most skillful group of general and cardiac surgeons. We descend from surgeons who developed effective techniques for open aortic repair: Voorhees, Crawford, and many others; carotid surgery fostered by Eastcott, DeBakey, and many others; lessons learned in the management of venous diseases from Linton, Bergan, and many others; vascular trauma by Rich, Perry, and many others; saving ischemic limbs by Veith, Dardik, and many others; and endovascular techniques by Fogarty, Parodi, and many others.We are privileged to be Robert Rutherford, Eugene Strandness, Clement Darling II, Emerick Szilagy, Ronald Stoney, Robert Hobson, Anthony Imparato, John Manning, Wesley Moore, James Stanley, Allan Callow, and so many other illustrious surgeons and scholars.Ladies and gentlemen, we are not many, but we are special\u2014a very special group of surgeons with a proven capacity to learn, adapt, survive, and prosper. Accordingly, we are too proud of our heritage, we are too specialized, and we are too good to remain under the ultimate authority of another specialty.For years, the SVS has encouraged and supported the efforts of the American Board of Vascular Surgery to accomplish a most difficult task. In turn, the American Board of Vascular Surgery has created a pathway leading to the Primary Certificate. I trust and hope that it will continue to be ever active in the pursuit of our independence. Yes, the American Board of Vascular Surgery continues to deliver, and it has done an amazing job in getting us to where we are today.The time has come for the SVS to work side by side with the American Board of Vascular Surgery in this most formidable project. I have commissioned a delegation of highly capable SVS leaders to join an equally superb group of individuals from the American Board of Vascular Surgery. This committee will respect each other\u2019s viewpoints and is charged with the development of effective strategies that will ultimately lead to our independence as a specialty. Another important function of this committee will be to work towards an independent residency review committee for vascular surgery. Only with unity and resolve will our dream of having our own American Board of Medical Specialties\u2013approved board with our own residency review committee become a reality.Providing Value to SVS MembersThis year the SVS made several attempts to be responsive to your needs and to get you engaged in the affairs of the Society. As part of our efforts, the SVS conducted a member survey several months ago. I learned some interesting things from that survey about you and your colleagues:1You love this specialty.2You enjoy gathering with your peers to keep current.3You are excited by the latest developments and by opportunities to increase your personal skill levels.I also learned what you worry about. Overwhelmingly, you worry about competition from other specialties.At the end of the survey, we asked the question: \u201cwhat one thing should the SVS do for you?\u201d I have read pages and pages of responses from you. Two answers especially resonated with me: \u201cTreat me as a valued member\u201d and \u201cOne voice united.\u201d Those two statements summarize for me the underlying motivation for so many of the Society\u2019s activities this past year.The best way I can think of to offer value to you, as an SVS member, is to pay attention to what\u2019s on your mind and to focus the Society\u2019s activities on meeting those needs.I know that you are very concerned about competition from other specialties. While the form of that competition varies from community to community, the SVS is committed to addressing the issue nationally wherever it can. For example, it has developed credentialing statements for carotid stenting and for thoracic endovascular aortic repair. We have accelerated the process of writing our own clinical practice guidelines for the management of vascular diseases rather than signing off on guidelines headed by other specialties.Over the last 18 months, the SVS has geared up hands-on skills training in endovascular procedures for surgeons who did not receive training in catheter-based skills during their residency. In addition, the SVS is becoming a stronger and stronger advocate for the specialty as a whole. For a relatively small specialty, vascular surgery has disproportionate visibility and influence.This past February, the US Congress passed and President Bush signed legislation that would provide coverage for abdominal aortic aneurysm screening to at-risk Medicare beneficiaries. This legislation was conceived by the SVS and passed as a result of SVS leadership of the National Aneurysm Alliance, a coalition of medical societies, patient advocacy groups, and industry. This is the only new preventive benefit that was included in the budget reconciliation and is estimated to cost $200 million over 5 years. Robert Zwolak, who has over the years served the profession so ably on coding and reimbursement issues, provided extraordinary leadership on this issue. In addition, we have taken the pole position in the Fistula First Initiative, with Cliff Sales leading the way.As you see, we are responsive to your requests. We agree with you in that we can no longer send conflicting messages about who we are and what we do. Sure, we are vascular surgeons, but we are also vascular specialists who can render the best unbiased opinion regarding the optimal treatment modality to our patients. Why? Because we are the only experts in all three possible methods of treatment: pharmacologic, interventional, and surgical.As of today, we are the only complete modern vascular specialists. We need to trumpet this message across this country and Canada. And we need to do it together. Our competitors have portrayed us as a group of disparate surgeons struggling with our mission. At times we have been our own worst enemy despite our best intentions. Our past actions and complacency caused the competition to take advantage of the situation.There is no question that the SVS is poised to play a larger role in effectively positioning vascular surgeons as leaders in the management of vascular disease and vascular health. We have recently made available templates of letters, brochures, and posters to be forwarded to referring physicians highlighting our role as vascular specialists. Public awareness programs, including screening for vascular diseases, have been successfully implemented.The American Vascular Association under Bill Pearce and Bill Flinn has been instrumental in leading the effort for the prevention of catastrophic complications of vascular diseases.Additionally, the SVS has developed a speaker\u2019s bureau that would provide speakers to community hospitals, medical schools, and other venues, including the media. The VascularWeb under the direction of Wayne Johnston has also been revamped to be more accessible to the public and the media. Nearly 40% of the visits to our Web site are now from the public, seeking information about vascular conditions.Yes, we must vigorously publicize ourselves to the public and health care providers as the true experts in the management of peripheral vascular disease. We still have a lot of work ahead of us, and it is paramount that we speak with one voice in order to become a known consumer commodity.Extended endovascular techniquesIn terms of our remaining competitive in this arena, I believe that the best defense is a well-planned offense. It\u2019s time to concentrate on the next phase of our evolution, that is, to expand our scope of expertise outside the narrow boundaries our colleagues in other specialties might wish for us ().We must keep up with the trend set by our previous leaders who believed that we could no longer limit our practice to open techniques. They were so right!Perhaps one may seek comfort in the possibility that an ever-growing elderly population in this country will generate increased demand for vascular services in the next few decades. Conversely, tobacco use is in decline, statins are making inroads, antihypertensive therapy has improved, newer antiplatelet agents may be more effective, and so on. What if this multipronged medical approach to occlusive arterial disease makes a significant dent?Some of you may wonder why we should pursue the management of pathologies other than vascular. I am proposing that we stay within the vascular system, but why limit ourselves to cleaning the tracks while others can also reach the destination? We have not sinned, and we should be able to reach the promised land just like everyone else except for Moses.By this I don\u2019t mean to be controversial, divisive, or out of touch with current trends. On the contrary, my goal is to challenge our minds to look forward and unite ourselves to better serve our specialty and the future of our young surgeons.In this regard, let me ask you a couple of questions: Why are our average earnings less than interventional radiologists and cardiologists? They certainly don\u2019t work more than we do! Why have we been so complacent about other specialties moving into our field unchallenged while we are not allowed to take a walk in their backyard? They seem to have quickly learned the natural history of peripheral arterial disease in addition to cardiac diseases. They have mastered the conduits as well as the final destinations.The interventional radiologist has marched unimpeded into the realm of minimally invasive treatment of varicose veins and venous insufficiency while taking care of a myriad of arterial as well as nonvascular pathologies. They too have mastered the conduits as well as the final destinations.The answer to the observed differences between their specialties and our specialty is very simple. They speak with one voice, they are united, they have a powerful brand, and now more than ever they are focused on expanding the peripheral vascular portion of their business.As you may recall, during last year\u2019s Stanley Crawford Critical Issues Forum, I addressed this very topic. I gathered a group of preeminent vascular surgeons who believe that vascular surgery is quite capable of assimilating these new extended endovascular procedures with appropriate training. They were so convincing that many vascular surgeons have already subscribed to this new concept. Some are currently performing extended endovascular techniques, and some are about to start. However, the great majority will need further training. We have to move forward as the boundaries among medical specialties are vanishing rapidly.By now you will not be surprised when called to care for an infected foot ulcer in a patient who just underwent a balloon angioplasty of the superficial femoral artery by a cardiologist, the specialist of the heart.As more and more nonvascular surgeons direct their attention to our business, we may potentially see a drop in the average number of endovascular cases, just as we have recently experienced with open vascular techniques. Cardiac surgeons, for example, are rapidly mastering peripheral endovascular procedures since the number of open heart surgeries has declined significantly.Who could have ever imagined that a new specialty called interventional nephrology would actually exist? These specialists are now performing all types of endovascular procedures for access maintenance following only 6 to 8 weeks of training. As you all know, nephrologists control hemodialysis units and are being offered great financial incentives to direct their own access centers by venture capitalists.Interventional neurologists with their professed ability to perform carotid angioplasties should also be included in our assessment of manpower needs for the near future.How about vascular medicine specialists who also perform balloon angioplasties and stenting of the peripheral arteries?It is clear to me that we are witnessing a rising new trend. A number of medical specialties are willing to take unprecedented steps to share in the minimally invasive treatment of vascular patients.Thus, it is only prudent that we keep an open mind to new ideas that can enhance our ability to stay competitive and enrich our armamentarium. Needless to say, it is not my intention to motivate you to attempt procedures without a deep understanding of the disease process and before mastering these proposed techniques. I trust, on the basis of our history as careful, conscientious, and caring physicians, that we will take every necessary step to achieve our objectives in a most organized and scientific fashion. We must document our superiority in credentialing statements, practice guidelines, and outcomes research.The SVS is prepared to provide part of this training through well-structured academic agendas. Scientific programs will be designed, minifellowships will be offered by those who are already experts in the subject, and a concerted effort from other specialties, as well as industry, will help establish the new vascular specialist. In fact, this month, the SVS sponsored its first expanded endovascular interventions course. Drs Kim Hodgson and Alan Lumsden have been instrumental in making my wish a reality. The course was a success, with vascular surgeons developing skills with the help of coronary simulators and learning how to perform embolizations.The next generation of physicians must know that we are here to defend their interests. We must develop as vascular specialists if we and future vascular surgeons want to enjoy satisfying and lucrative practices across the country.Proposed vascular specialist training paradigmIs it possible that so many specialties will be doing the same procedures equally well without communicating with each other? It is reasonable to speculate that all specialties involved in the care of a vascular patient may converge and develop a combined residency program. Let me offer for your consideration a new training paradigm which may be of interest to the future generation of vascular specialists.Simply stated, this will include 3 years in surgical and medical rotations\u20142 years in vascular and endovascular techniques and 1 year in cardiac interventions. A well-crafted, non\u2013service-oriented 6-year program should provide sufficient time to address all aspects of central and peripheral vascular conditions.Advisory assembly of vascular organizationsThere are other opportunities to reach heights not previously seen by our Society. I believe that this can be accomplished if the SVS works in close collaboration with other vascular organizations. Although the SVS has a large board of directors, these elected officers no longer represent only their societies. They represent you, the SVS membership.Therefore, the new SVS has become more democratic and inclusive, but it is not a federation of societies.Early on during my presidency, I realized the importance of extending our open arms to all North American and regional vascular societies. I wanted to bring together the leaders of all these societies to discuss not only the survival of our clinical practice, but also many other pertinent issues affecting our lives as mentors, academicians, and researchers. We need to develop new and strategic pathways to safeguard our specialty and to grow scientifically and politically.Recommendations from this coalition of vascular societies could be disseminated across the nation in a very effective and expeditious manner. And what a great forum to communicate with each other on a regular basis!I am delighted to inform you that these overtures met with an overwhelming response. Every society enthusiastically accepted to participate in this endeavor by appointing their president, president-elect, and secretary to be active members of this new organization. This umbrella organization, named the Advisory Assembly of Vascular Societies, was officially inaugurated yesterday.The Assembly will be the think tank of vascular surgery, a blue-ribbon panel that will represent a strong chain uniting all of vascular surgery. This is the only such organization in existence, and we will be taking advantage of it in several ways: (1) learning from one another, (2) profiting from one another\u2019s strengths, (3) enhancing the connection with the SVS, (4) avoiding duplication of efforts, and (5) promoting one voice for vascular surgery by jointly addressing issues and developing collaborative strategies.Association of Chairs in Vascular Surgery (ACVS)One other way to strengthen vascular surgery is to investigate existing business and financial models of vascular services. There is much room for improvement in this arena, as little attention has been given to our specialty by hospital administrators.Many of us do not realize our own potential and value to the institution we serve. Issues related to the running of a vascular division are often limited to discussions with nonvascular physicians and administrators.The lack of an organization that allows vascular chairs to openly discuss divisional issues limits our ability to interact effectively with hospital administration and medical school leadership. Many potential benefits are not collected because often we don\u2019t know when, how, and why to ask for certain additional support.We have been well taught how to take care of patients and service the hospital where we work, but we were not taught how to collect our dues. Often, we provide enormous amount of work that is not reimbursed. We need to learn how to deal with our chairperson, our CEO, and our younger colleagues.We need to have less of a full-time mentality and become a bit more entrepreneurial; otherwise, we will not be able to cope with the constant cuts in reimbursement.Moreover, the time has come to address the issue of vascular surgery\u2019s not having its own department anywhere in this country. I know of many excellent departmental chairs who are vascular surgeons, but I don\u2019t know of any totally independent department of vascular surgery. How about the private practitioners who also render uncompensated work to their hospital? The time for us to be recognized and respected has arrived.For these and many other reasons, I had the opportunity to create a society to deal with these particular issues. With the endorsement of my colleagues Drs Gregory Sicard, Kenneth Ouriel, Alan Lumsden, Anton Sidawy, and Keith Calligaro, we introduced last year the ACVS.I encourage you all to attend this year\u2019s meeting and to contribute to it in any way you can. Dr Robert Hobson, the current president of the ACVS, will be happy to welcome you to the meeting tomorrow afternoon. Dr Peter Lawrence has put together a most exciting program.It is with great pleasure that I announce that the ACVS has agreed to be part of the SVS family and will function as a section of the SVS. This is a win/win situation for both societies. The SVS will have a strong business arm, and the ACVS will profit from the SVS administration and support while keeping its independence in terms of running its own affairs.We are also in the process of strengthening the educational arm of the SVS by inviting the Association of Program Directors in Vascular Surgery to join as a section member of the SVS. This approach will be beneficial for vascular surgery because we will be speaking with one voice in issues related to training and education. Just like with the ACVS, the Association of Program Directors in Vascular Surgery will maintain its independence to organize their biannual meetings, select their officers, and dictate future agendas.The SVS will continue to provide administrative and financial support to the Association of Program Directors in Vascular Surgery. I am glad to inform you that both the outgoing president, Jim Seeger, and the incoming president, Blair Keagy, are supportive of the proposed association.Internationalization of the SVSThe SVS is also committed to reach out to other national and regional vascular societies across the world. This outreach program has already started. For the first time ever, we are going to exchange scientific programs with the European Society for Vascular Surgery. This afternoon, the European Society for Vascular Surgery will conduct a very interesting minisymposium, and the SVS will reciprocate in their upcoming annual meeting in Prague.Our effort has been extended to several other nations that will be introduced during the International Vascular Symposium, to be held this afternoon immediately following the European symposium. Australia, Brazil, Egypt, India, Israel, Japan, and Mexico are the first countries to respond to our call.I trust that this list will get increasingly longer and that the newly formed International Relations Committee will ensure that this program continues successfully. In fact, this committee was fortunate to receive an endowment left to the International Society for Cardiovascular Surgery by my mentor Henry Haimovici. We are indebted to Drs Lazar Greenfield and Andy Whittemore for transferring this endowment of over a quarter of a million dollars to the SVS. This will allow us to bring young surgeons from developing countries to exchange ideas and to visit American institutions. I truly believe that the internationalization of the SVS will be of great benefit to our members.Clearly, there is much to gain from a closer connection with our international colleagues. Our planet is too small for us to miss the opportunity to enjoy a greater scientific and social interaction with our overseas colleagues.Lastly, we have cofounded with the European Society for Vascular Surgery and many other national societies the World Federation of Vascular Societies. The annual meeting for the Federation will be always in conjunction with a national meeting, and it will rotate among the various members. I want to recognize the efforts of Dr Henrik Sillensen, secretary-general of the European Society for Vascular Surgery, for all the work he has done in behalf of this new Federation.Evolution of the SVS and brandingWhile we are celebrating the 60th anniversary of the SVS, we are also recognizing that the merger of the American Association for Vascular Surgery and the SVS occurred only 3 years ago. This merger, which was conceptualized and implemented by Jack Cronenwett and Tom Riles, made it possible for us to dream of a society that represents all vascular surgeons while it is supported by all other vascular societies. The positive impact of the merger is apparent to all.Today, we speak with one voice. In just three short years we became a 24/7 active Society. We have an office in Chicago and a hard-working full-time staff of 15 individuals led by an outstanding executive director, Becky Maron.Equally important has been your active participation in the societal affairs. Never before have we seen such an outpouring of support from our members. You have volunteered your time and have generously responded to our fund-raising campaigns in record numbers. You have voiced your opinions, and the SVS has responded to your calls. Together we will accelerate our efforts to create a powerful brand now that we have agreed to be complete vascular specialists. The communication committee under Dr Bruce Perler\u2019s leadership is developing ambitious plans to market our specialty directly to the referring physicians, as well as to the public and the media. And, knowing Bruce, I can guarantee you it will be an awesome marketing promotion.Closing remarksAs the complexity of our specialty evolves and the challenges multiply, I anticipate an even larger role for the SVS. Therefore, we must continue to work on strengthening ourselves so that we can be the most effective and influential envoys of vascular surgery on this continent. We have to continue to reach out to the regional and national American and Canadian vascular societies and work in tandem with our overseas colleagues. There is so much to learn: there is so much to do.We should aggressively seek other venues to increase our clinical practice, and we can\u2019t forget that we must revisit our deals with hospitals and administration. We stand ready to initiate a large communication campaign to address the concept of a vascular specialist to our medical colleagues and to the lay public. We cannot afford to concentrate solely on the most current and exciting scientific data. Issues including reimbursement, ethics, and recognition of vascular surgery as a mature and independent specialty should be addressed.The winds of change are in the air in vascular surgery. If we are to succeed, we cannot be like a reed and return to the same place. We must march forward, activating the necessary changes to keep us viable and vibrant.Ladies and gentlemen, my tenure as your president is fast coming to a close. It\u2019s time for me to thank my children, Michael Sam and Andrea Rachel, for being there for me at all times and for being the inspiration of my life. To my sister Rachel, who came all the way from Brazil, I say thank you.Allow me now to share with you a well-kept secret, that is, the names of the people who work in my service and who helped me reach this unique prestigious position. They are my partner, Anil Hingorani, my administrator, Anne Ober, my nurse, Eleonora Iadgarova, my vascular lab director, Natalie Marks, and my research director, Theresa Jacob. I sincerely thank them for years of dedication and hard work.I also would like to thank the Executive Council and the Board of Directors of the SVS for their productivity and constant pursuit for excellence. This has been an exciting, instructive, and humbling experience for me. I thank our efficient and energetic administrative staff for carefully crafting this journey for all of us.This is just the beginning of a great new role for vascular surgery. I am confident that under the leadership of our next president, Craig Kent, the SVS will find new and worthwhile endeavors for our benefit. If and when challenges arise, we will face them with one voice and one powerful brand because united we stand!Thank you.",
  "2007": "It has to be one of life\u2019s most rewarding honors to serve as president of the society that embodies one\u2019s specialty. I recall my first Society for Vascular Surgery meeting in 1987, 20 years ago. It would have been beyond my most imaginable belief to think that I might some day be president of this organization. Although I won\u2019t burden you with \u201cthank yous,\u201d I want to express my admiration and warmest gratitude to three individuals: Ron Stoney, John Mannick, and Andy Whittemore. These are my mentors. They have served as role models for me throughout my career. I am deeply appreciative of the fact that they helped and cared at each step along the way.I would be remiss if I did not also express my gratitude to my parents. As Wayne mentioned, my father was a rancher with only a high school education, and my mom, a schoolteacher. During my years on the ranch I learned from my parents the value of hard work, the importance of honesty and integrity, the value of family, and the satisfaction that a passion for one\u2019s profession can bring. These lessons have served me well over the years. I would also like to thank my children, Alycia and Eric, for being patient with me this past year and all of the years. My love for my profession is only superseded by my love for you.Vascular surgeons as leadersToday more than ever, vascular surgeons need to be leaders. In the year 2015, there will be 87 million Americans older than the age of 55. We know that the prevalence of vascular disease in this age group is 12% and thus many of these individuals will become our patients. Our future patients will need\u2014and deserve\u2014expert and innovative care.Vascular surgeons, until recently, have been the practitioners that have led the way. A bit of history: Until the 1950s vascular disease was synonymous with old age. Most individuals with cardiovascular disease died of a heart attack in their 50s, 60s, or early 70s, and the remainder who survived to manifest peripheral vascular disease, suffered amputation or died of stroke, renal failure, or ruptured aneurysm.Enter the vascular surgeon. Pioneers such as Kunlin, Debakey, Wylie, Sylagli, Strandness, and so many others invented operations, developed devices, and investigated the natural history of vascular disease. All of these advancements allowed vascular surgeons to care for a growing population of patients. We were the leaders! We maintained this leadership role throughout many decades into the 80s and early 90s. We were successful for many reasons but primarily because of our devotion to our patients and our desire for excellence. We were also aided by the fact that the technology did not dramatically change. We may have produced better outcomes in the 90s than in the 60s, but thesurgicalprincipals remained the same. Moreover and importantly, no one else wanted to care for these patients. Vascular surgeons were hard working, technically precise, persistent individuals known for caring for a highly complex group of patients. God knows, nobody else wanted to perform an 8-hour femoral\u2013pedal bypass!But in the late 90s, minimally invasive techniques matured, at first slowly but then more rapidly. It was no longer an onerous task to care for a patient with vascular disease. The required skill sets with the advent of catheter techniques overlapped with the skills of other interventionalists. Reimbursement for minimally invasive procedures became more favorable than traditional surgery, and there were more patients in need of treatment.In a matter of 10 years, the world changed dramatically for vascular surgeons. Instead of being leaders, in many ways we have become followers. Much of the new technology that we frequently use today was championed by others while we stayed on the sidelines fighting vehemently for the status quo. We let other organizations write the guidelines for vascular disease. Other groups worked with companies to develop and test new techniques. We let other specialists come into our communities and become the primary care providers for our patients. In sum, our position as leaders in the treatment of vascular disease has been and continues to be challenged.Well, none of this is new to you. The problem has been described by too many and on too many occasions. But what is the solution? Vascular surgeons need to recapture their role as leaders in vascular care. Although societies can help in this endeavor\u2014and for the remainder of this address you will hear that the Society for Vascular Surgery is devoted to this mission\u2014leadership needs to occur on an individual level. Vascular surgeons need to be leaders in vascular care in their local communities. The Society for Vascular Surgery can help produce this image; however, it is the responsibility of every individual in this room to rise to a leadership role. If each of us takes on this mission, collectively we will be successful.What are the leadership qualities that will allow us, individually, to accomplish this charge? There are many qualities of a leader. I have chosen several that I believe are important for us today.SkillThe first is skill. Vascular surgeons are already known as master surgeons. There are few who would debate that vascular surgeons perform amongst the most technically difficult procedures. However, we need to assure the world that we are also master physicians and that we can medically manage our patients with the latest pharmacy and with an in-depth understanding of the natural history of vascular disease. We need to perform catheter intervention with the same ability and skill as we do open surgery. Whatever the technique, we must be regarded as the best. It is easy to follow a leader that is able and skilled.PassionThe second characteristic of leadership is passion. A love of what we do. Admittedly, during the past few years, passion has been difficult to engender. Our world has been complex; and for many of us, it still is. There is, however, a great deal more certainty now than there was a few years ago. It is truly a great time to be a vascular surgeon. We have at our command two entirely different skills sets. We are open surgeons and also endovascular surgeons. Our patients have benefited from our new skills. They are able to survive longer and have fewer complications. Our lifestyle is improving, and we are paid more for endovascular techniques. There is good reason today for vascular surgeons to have passion.VisionThe third attribute of leadership is vision. Theodore Hesburgh once said, \u201cThe very essence of leadership is that you must have a vision.\u201d We need to be capable of predicting the future; we can\u2019t live in the past. What will vascular intervention be like 10 years from now? How do we move the specialty and ourselves to that place? What do our patients want? Embracing the status quo is rarely a characteristic of a true leader. New endovascular or medical technologies need to be developed by vascular surgeons.ServiceThe fourth attribute is service. As vascular surgeons, we have always been good at this; today we need to be better. Do we place our patients first and foremost? Are we providing continuity of care, a custom not always offered by other vascular interventionalists? Do we communicate well with our patients and with our referring physicians? Our patients and referring physicians might be transiently enamored by promises of innovation, new technology, and minimal invasiveness, but ultimately, they want a solid, thoughtful, and communicative physician providing care.OptimismThe last and perhaps most important attribute of the vascular surgeon leader is optimism. A philosopher once said, \u201cI can\u2019t change the direction of the wind, but I can adjust my sails to always reach my destination.\u201d The treatment of vascular disease will evolve. We cannot control this evolution, but we can be the ones to help it find its way. Medical students and residents follow an optimistic leader. Referring physicians want to hear that we are strong and positive about our profession. Patients need to hear our confidence. Optimism is a shining star that everyone follows.There are many attributes of leadership; these are only a few. However, I believe at this juncture that these are attributes that are critical to our success in creating, maintaining, and expanding dominance for the specialty of vascular surgery. I have little doubt that vascular disease in the future will be treated by many specialists. It is estimated that in 2030 there will be almost 2 million vascular procedures performed each year. There is plenty to go around. The question is, who will be regarded as the leaders in vascular care? Let\u2019s use these qualities\u2014that are present within each of us\u2014to send a clear message that the specialty in the lead is vascular surgery.Evolution and maturation of the Society for Vascular SurgerySo how can the Society for Vascular Surgery help recreate this leadership role for vascular surgeons? Let me begin by telling you about today\u2019s SVS. We have evolved over the past several years in a way that is unprecedented.Where was the SVS 5 years ago? There were two societies, a division of leadership with competition between the SVS and the American Association for Vascular Surgery (AAVS). The SVS had no central administrative support. Our sole function, for the most part, was to run a national meeting. We were struggling with our identity. Should we be independent or should we not? How should we relate to the larger community of surgery? While the society was struggling, so were our members with a transformation in the way vascular surgery was practiced; our field was being redefined.Where is the SVS today? I would say strong and well. This began with the merger of the SVS and AAVS in 2003 to create an all-inclusive society, today\u2019s SVS. We now have an office in Chicago with central administrative leadership. We have a sub-board in vascular surgery and a primary certificate. Not that the struggle for independence is over, but we have learned that independence of our specialty can be achieved in many ways, not just by the establishment of a separate board. The SVS has mature infrastructure put in place by our recent leaders. And with strong infrastructure has come great productivity. Many times through the year, I have asked myself why I was the fortunate one with the opportunity to inherit the society at such a great time. It was my predecessors, Jack Cronenwett, Tom Riles, Dick Green, Greg Sicard, and Enrico Ascher, who struggled through the years to create what is now a unified, mature, and functional organization.Today\u2019s SVS has approximately 2300 members. We have an annual budget of $4.7 million and employ 11 individuals who work either at our central office in Chicago or in our ancillary office in Washington, DC. We have many goals, all with the central mission of empowering vascular surgeons. Our initiatives are numerous and include the areas of clinical practice, recruitment, education, research, branding, communications, international relations, advocacy, and reimbursement. Our goal over the past several years has been to make this your society, with a focus on the community-practicing vascular surgeon.We have many activities\u2014as you will see\u2014and participation in the activities of the society has been broad. To provide you with perspective, in 2003 there were 14 committees of the SVS with 93 volunteers for these positions. In 2007, only 4 years later, there are a total of 37 councils, committees, or working groups with over 250 individuals involved in societal activities. Inclusive are many of you in this room.The SVS wants broad participation. In fact, we have adopted a new policy where candidates for councils, committees, and leadership positions are chosen from solicited volunteers. This approach has led to significant enthusiasm on the part of SVS members. In 2007 we requested volunteers for 26 vacancies and over 120 individuals applied for these positions. We are working hard. Over this past year, there were more than 270 conference calls. The SVS Executive Council met by phone, without fail, every other Tuesday evening, and we estimate over 5000 hours were logged by vascular surgeons for SVS related efforts just this year.So what have we accomplished? I will not try to be comprehensive. In fact, it would be impossible in a 3-hour address to describe the depth and detail of the societies\u2019 activities. I will, however, try to highlight a few of our more important programs and emphasize how these programs will empower you to be leaders in vascular care.Societal initiativesEducationLet us begin with education. Education encompasses many themes. Today, however, the most important educational goal of our society is to train vascular surgeons in new and innovative technology. In support of this goal, it is my hope that we are able to provide for every vascular surgeon the opportunity to be trained in the full spectrum of endovascular techniques. It is here that I would like to introduce the concept of the fully endocompetent vascular surgeon, an individual who can perform expertly all endovascular techniques for peripheral vascular disease regardless of their complexity. This individual would have competence in all of the latest technology, including cerebral protection devices, .014 and rapid exchange systems, re-entry devices, and the like.To accomplish this task, there is a clear need for comprehensive endovascular training. As such, the SVS is in the process of developing new training paradigms that have as their goal the achievement of full competence in various endovascular techniques. As a pilot for these programs we have chosen carotid stenting. A new committee has been recently established under the auspices of the Education Council that is in the process of creating a program for comprehensive training in carotid stenting. Here is how this training program will function:\u2022Interested and qualified individuals will applyto the SVSfor carotid stent training.\u2022Selection of trainees will be based upon prior endovascular experience and the likelihood that the trainee will eventually be able to perform carotid stenting at his or her local institution.\u2022For candidates that are chosen, an individualized training program will be designed that includes didactics, simulation, and hands-on experience. Trainees will be guaranteed access to at least 30 cerebral angiograms and 25 carotid stents over a period of a year.The novel element of this training paradigm will be that it has as an end point, the achievement of competence in carotid stenting. We will consider this program successful only if all of its trainees become credentialed at their local institutions and eventually develop active practices in carotid stenting. The SVS has partnered with Cordis Endovascular in the development of this program. We expect to begin taking applications within the next month and initially four candidates will be chosen. Our hope is to expand the program to over 20 surgeons within the year. Building on what we anticipate to become a novel and successful paradigm for training, we intend soon thereafter to partner with EV3 to develop a similar program for training surgeons in advanced therapies for lower extremity occlusive disease. I am hopeful that many of you will take advantage of these programs.I have described just one of the SVS Education Council\u2019s programs; however, there are many more that I do not have time to discuss in detail. A few of these are as follows:\u2022An Educational Products Committee has begun the process of establishing an online clearinghouse of educational information that has been evaluated by the committee and deemed useful for SVS members.\u2022The Post Graduate Education Committee will continue with its very successful courses in coding and is developing new courses in practice management and in the endovascular arena. These latter efforts are supported by robust grants from Abbott Laboratories and Boston Scientific.\u2022The annual meeting Program Committee, under the leadership of Rich Cambria, has created a superb meeting this year. New offerings include joint sessions with other vascular organizations, six breakfast sessions, as well as an R&D presentation from corporate partners. I want to personally thank Rich for the outstanding effort that he has made this year. It is not widely understood the amount of time necessary to create and manage the annual meeting.\u2022A Vascular Self-Assessment Program (VSAP) is being developed by the SVS with an anticipated first version in 2008. Like SESAP for general surgery, VSAP will help vascular surgeons keep up to date and prepared for their recertifying examinations.\u2022Lastly, I am proud to announce that the SVS has become the editor ofRutherford\u2019s Textbook of Vascular Surgery. Rutherford\u2019s text has become an icon in vascular surgery, and we are eager to have the SVS carry on this important tradition.None of these activities would have occurred without the able leadership of Peter Lawrence, chair of the Education Council, and the administrative assistance of Patricia Burton from the Society office.BrandingSo why doesn\u2019t everyone realize that a vascular surgeon should be the practitioner of choice for their patients with vascular disease? There are several logical reasons why they should!1First, we arethe only specialists devoted completely to the care of vascular patients. Although there is variation, interventional radiologists spend on average 30% of their time caring for vascular patients, cardiologists about 10%, and nephrologists, neurosurgeons, dermatologists, and neurointerventionalists even less. For vascular surgeons, the number is now and will always be 100%. If there is one concept that has been repeatedly proven in medicine, specialization leads to improved patient care.2Perhaps even more importantly, we arethe only vascular practitioners who have the potential to provide all forms of therapy for our patients: medical, catheter-based, and operative. For the fully trained vascular surgeon, there is no conflict. There are multiple options in the tool kit and the ability to freely decide what is best for our patients.This all does seem to be good news, does it not? Unfortunately, perceptions do not always translate into reality. Although we think we are omnipotent, the rest of the world does not necessarily share this viewpoint! Is it possible that vascular surgery is one of the best-kept secrets in medicine?The SVS recently contracted a marketing agency to gain the unbiased perceptions of 70 referring physicians randomly chosen from around the country. Although the details of this analysis will be presented at a branding session on Saturday, I would like to share with you a few highlights. When asked about the types of procedures typically performed by vascular surgeons, 85% of these physicians stated that vascular surgeons provide surgical services that are invasive and complex. These same medical physicians refer patients with less complex disease to cardiologists or interventional radiologists for less invasive procedures. More than 25% of primary care physicians disagreed with the statement that vascular surgeons perform angioplasty and stenting. Moreover, more than 20% disagreed with the statement that vascular surgeons are trained and experienced in medical management of patients with peripheral vascular disease. So much for the assertion that we are triple threats, with medical, percutaneous, and surgical options for our patients.It is clear that we as vascular surgeons, with the help of the SVS, need to reverse these perceptions. To accomplish this task, 2 years ago the SVS established a Communications Committee within the society under the leadership of Bruce Perler. We complimented this committee with a public relations and communications team lead by Jill Goodwin. There have been numerous initiatives that the society has undertaken to brand vascular surgeons on a national level. Accomplishments within the last year include:\u2022Prominent vascular surgeons were featured inThe New York Times, Newsweek, and theWall Street Journal. In fact, vascular surgery and the society have been featured in hundreds of newspapers and journals this past year as well as on PBS. This coverage reached 48 million Americans with our message \u201csee a vascular surgeon.\u201d\u2022Vascular surgery and the society were highlighted in the Ultimate SAAVE Campaign featuring Jim Craig, who is in our audience today, the world famous captain of the US hockey team who lost his father to an undiagnosed ruptured aneurysm.\u2022Sponsored by Cook Incorporated, crews are at this meeting taping a 30-second public service announcement delivered by 50 vascular surgeons that will be aired on television and radio stations across the country.\u2022A branding tool kit has been created and is being released at this meeting. These are comprehensive materials that members can use to educate referring physicians and promote their practices to the public and to the media. This tool kit was included in your meeting tote bag and is available electronically on Vascular Web. Inclusive in this tool kit are:1instructions for creating a Web site,2media interviewing messages and guidelines,3a complete 1-year media plan with supporting materials,4Power Point presentations for grand rounds on specific topics\u2014lower extremity vascular disease, carotid artery disease, aortic aneurysms, and venous disease,5guidelines for hosting a dinner for primary care physicians,6brochures that describe the various diseases that vascular surgeons treat as well as the procedures we perform, and7a separate tool kit for developing a screening eventAs leaders, we not only need to be skilled and to have a passion for our work but it is also necessary to communicate our talents and strengths to the rest of the world. I would encourage all of you to use these tools that the society has provided and create a grass roots initiative in your local communities. Let the public and referring physicians know that vascular surgeons are leaders in vascular care. Let\u2019s change perceptions and let the world know our true potential.RecruitmentTo remain a viable specialty we need to recruit the best and the brightest. Moreover, we need to increase our numbers to be capable of caring for the almost doubling of vascular interventions that will take place over the next 20 years. The SVS in concert with the Association of Program Directors in Vascular Surgery is actively addressing this issue. We now have 119 finishing fellows; I submit that the number needs to increase to 200 for vascular surgery to maintain its dominant role in the treatment of vascular disease. I also submit that many of you here today have vascular practices that are sufficiently robust to allow development of your own fellowship program. Moreover, those of you who have existing fellowships could increase your complement. The submission of an application for a new fellowship program can be an intimidating process, and the SVS wants to help. We have created infrastructure within the SVS to assist in the development of your fellowship application. The SVS can offer the following resources\u2022an administrator associated with the SVS office, who has significant expertise in preparing an application for a new fellowship,\u2022templates of applications,\u2022a list of directors for 0/5, 3/3, 4/2, and 5/2 programs who are willing to offer advice and assistance during the application process, and\u2022access to the vascular surgery representatives to the residency review committees who will also provide guidance and advice.I would ask everyone in this room to consider whether your practice will support a high-quality fellowship. If the answer is yes, consider using SVS resources to make this happen. Help us increase the number of vascular fellowship positions to 200.Accompanying this initiative are many others directed at enhancing our recruitment efforts. We have with us today over 70 students and residents from around the country who have an interest in vascular surgery. Could I have our visitors stand for a round of applause?Other initiatives related to recruitment include:\u2022a white paper on how to identify funding for 0/5 programs,\u2022a yearly mailing to first-, second-, and third-year general surgical residents encouraging them to consider a career in vascular surgery,\u2022the establishment of a resident and student section of the SVS, and\u2022a mentoring program linking SVS members with residents/students.I would like to thank WL Gore for its generous support of the activities of the recruitment task force and its help in developing these recruitment initiatives.ResearchBeing at the vanguard in research should be a critical goal of vascular surgeons if we are to maintain a leadership role in the treatment of vascular disease. True leaders have vision. They understand where their specialty will be in 10 years. If our referring physicians as well as the public perceive vascular surgeons to be innovators of new treatments and technology and responsible for measuring outcomes, they will look to us to care for their patients. Shouldn\u2019t the nextNew England Journal of Medicinearticle addressing peripheral stenting versus angioplasty emanate from vascular surgeons?One of the missions of the SVS over the last year has been to reinvigorate clinical research in the society. At a fall retreat of the Research Council, under the leadership of Rick Powell, a 5-year strategy for research was created, and the following are some of the initiatives that were developed:\u2022We learned from our industrial colleagues that vascular surgeons, compared with other specialists, frequently do not have the infrastructure or the focus to effectively carry out clinical trials. To rectify this problem, the SVS in partnership with industry has developed a yearly clinical research course, the purpose of which is to mentor vascular surgeons in the methodology of clinical trials as well as prospective clinical studies.\u2022We have also created a clinical research database on the SVS Web site, which will be searchable and contains information regarding over 160 potential vascular surgery trial sites.\u2022The SVS has introduced three yearly $15,000 seed grants designed to encourage SVS members to develop proposals for multicenter clinical trials. Applications will be reviewed by the newly formed Clinical Research Committee, and the recipients will be chosen based on the merit and the potential of the trial to eventually receive peer-reviewed support.\u2022In selected instances, clinical research will be conducted within the SVS. The SVS has just recently developed a partnership with Lifeline Screening. Lifeline has agreed to provide the SVS with its complete data set of over 5 million people screened for vascular disease as well as the resources to analyze this data. We anticipate that the findings from the analysis will be pivotal and provide new information about which patients should be the target of screening.As you can see, the SVS strongly believes that leadership requires vision, and vision can be enhanced by vascular surgeons being leaders in research.AdvocacyIn the arena of advocacy, the SVS has made a significant impact! We led the effort to gain reimbursement for screening for abdominal aortic aneurysms, which came to fruition in January of this year. In sum, the SVS was responsible for the first-ever preventive benefit available for patients with vascular disease.Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) reimbursement for carotid stenting has been in flux and controversial. As most of you know, the SVS has played an active role in this process working closely with the Food and Drug Administration, CMS, and other governmental agencies. Owing to the efforts of the SVS and its individual members, these agencies consider vascular surgeons as major stakeholders in carotid stenting. The carotid stent registry developed by the SVS and supported by Boston Scientific now includes over 3700 patients and has set the standard for measuring outcomes for carotid intervention. Recently, CMS considered a proposal to expand coverage of carotid stenting to include high-risk asymptomatic patients. SVS was integrally involved in this process, advocating that CMS increase coverage for anatomic high-risk patients but not at physiologic high risk. SVS\u2019s comments to CMS were heard, and in April the proposal to increase coverage of carotid stenting for asymptomatic physiologic high-risk patients was rejected pending further study. The role of the SVS in this process was pivotal.These and many other initiatives have been developed under the auspices of the Clinical Practice Council, ably led by Keith Calligaro. The Clinical Practice Council is also overseeing the development of practice standards, reporting standards, and credentialing papers. We are setting new definitions for vascular disease from the perspective of vascular surgeons.ReimbursementWe need to thank the Governmental Relations Committee and its active membership for the many initiatives surrounding reimbursement. This group has achieved so much, however, one accomplishment is especially notable. As we all know, the Deficit Reduction Act, which went into effect in January of this year, provided across the board cuts to the technical component of all office-based imaging services, including vascular ultrasound and physiologic testing. However, in an effort organized by the SVS, which included almost 800 letters sent from SVS members and an additional 18 members of congress to CMS, plus vigorous lobbying by the SVS Government Relations staff, the physiologic vascular lab codes were removed from these cuts. Physiologic vascular labs or ankle-brachial index measurements are performed primarily by vascular surgeons and account for $62 million worth of services each year. Let me be clear: SVS related efforts this past year have saved vascular surgeons on a yearly basis over $60 million in vascular testing revenue. Remember this dollar amount next time you are asked to donate to the SVS political action committee.ClosingThere are so many additional areas where the society has made great advances. We have made headway in international relations and in communications. We now have a newspaper and a biweekly e-mail update to our members. I wish I had the time to describe it all.Perhaps some of you are wondering if we are doing too much? Is the society spread too thin? Have we lost focus? I can tell you with assurance: this is not the case. We are 2300 strong, 2300 passionate, devoted, innovative, and hard working individuals. There is little we can\u2019t accomplish. As Henry Ford once said, \u201cNothing is particularly hard if you divide it into small jobs.\u201d We now have the infrastructure in a robust society to accomplish all of this. We are supported by Becky Maron our executive director and a team of 10 superb individuals in our administrative office. Becky, will you and your team rise for a round of applause?How should I end? None better than with a prescription from the SVS for success. Each of us needs to return to our community with a mission\u2026 to let the world know that we areskilledsurgeons and skilled interventionalists; that we arepassionateabout our specialty, that we havevision, that we are best atservice. Most importantly, that we areoptimisticabout the future. With this prescription, I am assured that the world will perceive VASCULAR SURGEONS AS LEADERS IN VASCULAR CARE!I will close by saying again what an honor it has been to be your president, an honor that in my life is unparalleled. Thank you for your time. Be well.",
  "2008": "Does the Society for Vascular Surgery (SVS) need to exist? This is a frank but reasonable question.A decade ago, many of us took for granted that vascular surgery was durable and unchanging. The specialty primarily dealt with major open surgery. But then things began to change.For many vascular surgeons, the past decade or more been has insecure and uncertain for a number of reasons. Many of us were slow to recognize and embrace the changes that were occurring in our specialty and to provide comprehensive vascular care, including minimally invasive and open surgery. It has taken a decade to learn and practice the new interventional skills and to show our referring doctors that we are a changed specialty. We are among the smallest of the specialties and we were divided. We didn't always listen well to each other, we didn't understand each others' views, and for a time we didn't work together. During this time, cardiologists, interventional radiologists, and cardiothoracic surgeons increasingly began treating vascular diseases.As a result of these and other factors during the past decade of change, we began losing our independent identity as the vascular specialists.Future trends that will affect vascular surgeryWe live in changing times and our future may still seem uncertain. What will our future hold? To answer this question and develop strategic plans for the SVS, the SVS Board of Directors met in February 2008. I list five future trends that are likely to affect vascular surgery over the next decade:\u2022We will have increased vascular patient numbers because of the influence of the diabetes\u2013obesity epidemic. The number of older people will double as people live longer and the baby boomers join the age >65 population. Unless we increase the number of vascular surgeons, there will be too few to meet the demands for vascular care and other specialties will step in.\u2022Patient expectations will be different. Patients from the baby boomer generation will request earlier treatment, particularly minimally invasive interventions, to maintain their active lifestyles.\u2022Science and technology trends will mean that future treatment will be even less invasive because of improved imaging resolution and further miniaturization of devices. The results of basic science work will continue to advance the prevention and care of vascular diseases. New pharmacology will control the rate of aneurysm dilatation and carotid plaque progression and will limit restenosis and allow more aggressive minimally invasive interventions.\u2022Economic trends related to the United States (US) health care system will have a negative impact. To address the high cost of health care, reimbursement for medical care will continue to decline. Reimbursement for surgical specialties will continue to fall disproportionately as more funds are shifted to primary care. The Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) will attempt to link payment to outcomes by withholding payment unless the efficacy of a treatment is documented.\u2022Legislative trends may also have a negative impact. To provide better access to health care, one of the models of universal health care will be introduced. Practice will be more regulated by emphasizing practice guidelines and requiring mandatory tracking of outcomes for our commonly performed procedures.These future trends will affect the SVS and vascular surgery.Purpose of the SVSI asked the question \u201cDoes the SVS need to exist?\u201d The message in this address is straightforward. Yes, the SVS does need to exist to address the future trends I just described and to advance vascular surgery.To this end, the SVS Board of Directors recommended three major goals for the Society:1To promote the independent identity of vascular surgery.2To advance comprehensive vascular care that includes open and endovascular interventions, vascular laboratory diagnosis, imaging, and others.3To be the recognized voice for vascular surgeons.A strategic planCreating this statement of our overall goals is merely an intellectual exercise unless we develop specific objectives and realistic plans of action to achieve the goals. The SVS plan for the future brings together the previous work of the Society and our proposed strategies.In this address, I will describe our six specific objectives under the following headings: promoting independent identity, advancing comprehensive care through education, research, and training more vascular surgeons, and being a recognized voice by being an authoritative voice and an influential voice. For each of these objectives, I will describe our action plans.Note that there are other objectives and action plans that we could have added. However, our budget required that we choose those that are most likely to meet our goals.SVS will promote the independent identity of vascular surgeryThe first objective of the SVS plan is to promote the independent identity of vascular surgery and to ensure that primary care physicians realize that only vascular surgeons can provide comprehensive vascular care.For the past decade, we have had a vigorous debate about independence of our specialty and how to achieve it. One year ago, we formed the Vascular Surgery Action Committee (VSAC), chaired by Jack Cronenwett, and asked them to recommend optimal methods to promote independence for the specialty. They concluded that \u201cindependence\u201d of a specialty is determined by two factors: (1) control of training and certification and (2) ownership of the identity of being the vascular disease specialists. I will address these two issues separately.Control of training and certificationControl of training and certification is a function of Board and Residency Review Committee status. VSAC recommended that we negotiate with The American Board of Surgery (ABS) with the goal of clearly defining vascular surgery as a separate specialty, independent of general surgery.In December 2007, Pat Clagett, Jack Cronenwett, and I met with senior members of ABS leadership. The details of this meeting and subsequent negotiations were distributed, and the SVS Board unanimously approved the agreement we negotiated. The essential components of the agreement with the ABS are the following.The ABS agreed that \u201cgeneral surgery residents are no longer trained to treat the full spectrum of arterial vascular disease, and vascular surgery fellowship training is now essential for finishing residents who wish to practice in this area.\u201d And that \u201cfuture surgeons who wish to practice comprehensive vascular surgery should complete an accredited vascular fellowship and obtain the vascular surgery certificate\u201d. The ABS agree to change its bylaws \u201cto formally recognize that the Vascular Surgery Board, chaired by John Ricotta, has full authority to make all decisions related to vascular surgery training, certification standards, and examination development.\u201dThus, the first component of independence, having control of training and certification, is now enshrined in the Vascular Surgery Board.Establish ownership of the identity of \u201cvascular disease\u201d specialistsThe second component of independence of our specialty is to actually have ownership of the identity of being the vascular disease specialists. Owning identity depends on having a consistent message. We have three components to our action plan:Our message is simple and consistentVascular surgeons are the only specialists who can offer comprehensive vascular care, including open and minimally invasive procedures.To whom do we target our message?The SVS Communications Committee, chaired by Mickey Meier, commissioned two nationwide surveys of primary care doctors and of patients and concluded that the way to achieve a better understanding of our specialty was through education of primary care physicians. To brand our identity to patients would have an exorbitant multimillion dollar cost.How to brand our independent identityCan the SVS brand our identity through a national campaign? No. We can only do it locally. We need the support of the members of the SVS and the members from the regional vascular societies to establish a grassroots campaign. Specifically we need to make our branding effort part of the everyday practice of every vascular surgeon. Our highly successful practitioners have reminded us that all \u201csales are local,\u201d and the best way to brand the identity of vascular surgeons is using one-on-one contact. After each office or clinic visit, I encourage you to use paper, the telephone, or preferably \u201cface-to-face time\u201d to deliver your message (which is our message) directly to one of your primary care doctors. We are the only ones that can provide comprehensive vascular care.SVS will be the preeminent source for continuing educationOur members have told the Education Council, chaired by Peter Lawrence, that one of the very important objectives for the SVS is to help keep their knowledge current. Hence, the SVS aims to be the preeminent source for continuing education on vascular disease by organizing education programs and publications. I will summarize five of the many components to our education action plan.Annual meetingThe structure of our annual meeting is evolving in response to your requests. This year, the Annual Meeting Program Committee, chaired by Rich Cambria has done an outstanding job in expanding the program and providing new formats that will enhance your satisfaction of the meeting.New Continuing Medical Education formatsWe recognize the need to provide your Continuing Medical Education (CME) opportunities in a format that is most convenient for you. Tell us what format best suits your busy schedule: traditional meetings and seminars, DVDs, podcasts, or webinars.Skills trainingA decade ago, the SVS recognized the importance of retraining vascular surgeons to meet the needs of our changing specialty and organized didactic lectures, simulator training, and hands on training in endovascular techniques. These efforts have helped reshape our specialty.We aim to continue to be sure that practicing vascular surgeons acquire advanced endovascular skills. With corporate support, we have developed hands-on training and mentoring in carotid stenting and lower extremity interventions under the leadership of Peter Schneider and Sean Lynden, respectively. Announcements of these programs are on VascularWeb.PublicationsOur publications are very strong. TheJournal of Vascular Surgeryremains the best vascular journal and one of the leading surgical journals worldwide under the editorship of Jack Cronenwett and Jim Seeger, who will be followed next year by the newly appointed editors, Tony Sidawy and Bruce Perler.Our newspaper, theVascular Specialist, under the editorship of George Andros, is popular and distributes our message of comprehensive care to SVS members and to an additional 5000 physicians in other specialties.To be sure that the name Bob Rutherford remains associated with vascular surgery education, the SVS has assumed sponsorship of Rutherford's textbook, which is currently undergoing revision for publication of its 7th edition.VascularWeb is our main portal for communication with our members and patients and has more than 3,000,000 visits per year. A work group, chaired by Pat O'Hara, is reviewing its structure and content to be sure it meets your high expectations. Be sure to direct your patients and referring doctors to the patient section of VascularWeb, which contains authoritative information on vascular diseases, diagnosis, and treatment. Note that this section is widely cited in MedlinePlus, which is the patient information site that is provided by the National Library of Medicine and National Institutes of Health.Maintenance of CertificationMaintenance of Certification (MOC) has been mandated by the American Board of Medical Specialties and is here to stay. Our MOC committee, chaired by John Ricotta, will assist you to understand and comply with MOC.In addition to taking a recertification examination administered by the Vascular Surgery Board, there are two additional requirements for MOC: you must accumulate CME hours and you must participate in self-assessment activities. To help you meet the requirement for participation in self-assessment activities, the SVS has two programs. First, in each issue theJVSthere are multiple-choice questions related to the published articles. Second, an SVS committee, chaired by Kim Hodgson, has developed the Vascular Education and Self-Assessment Program (VESAP), which is similar to the Surgical Education and Self-Assessment Program (SESAP) from the American College of Surgeons and will be available later this summer.SVS will foster research that will optimize patient careThe next objective of the SVS is to foster research that will optimize patient care.Why support research?Why support research? Our previous research innovations have improved the care of patients with vascular disease and helped establish our ownership of aneurysms, peripheral arterial disease, carotid disease, and venous disease. Furthermore, over the past decade, when the independence and existence of our specialty was in doubt, vascular surgeons have made the major contributions to endovascular treatment and some of the most important contributions to the basic science understanding of aortic aneurysms and the problem of restenosis after vascular intervention.The SVS has developed several programs with the help of the Research Council, chaired by Rick Powell, the Research and Education Committee, chaired by Larry Kraiss, the Outcomes Committee, chaired by Greg Sicard, and the American Vascular Association (AVA), chaired by Bill Pearce. I will mention only two of our research action plans.Importance of the vascular surgical researcherProbably the biggest challenge to conducting medical research today is the lack of qualified surgical researchers who can do the basic science and also can link the results of their basic science work to clinical practice\u2014so called the translational research.As you heard yesterday from Bill Pearce, Chair of the AVA, for 2008 the AVA Award Program totaled approximately $900,000. Ron Stoney is President of the Board of Trustees of The Foundation for Accelerated Vascular Research, formerly called the Pacific Vascular Research Foundation, and provides an annual Wylie Scholar Research Grant Award in the amount of $150,000.Because those who innovate dominate, I want to emphasize the importance of our fund-raising effort by our foundation. The AVA is at the forefront of our efforts to promote the next generation of translational researchers and with their new focus to support other SVS programs. If you have not made an AVA donation, please give.Vascular registryThe value of the data from the SVS carotid stenting and endarterectomy registry was shown in this morning's paper from the Outcomes Committee. We plan to expand our registry to include lower extremity, renal and other areas.Why have a registry? First, to help establish standards and improve the care of patients with vascular disease. As clinicians, this should be our primary goal. Second, to document the effectiveness of our treatments.As overall health care costs continue to rise, only effective treatment will be funded and reimbursed. With the SVS registry, we have the opportunity to determine the clinical effectiveness of our procedures in the real-world environment, including late results and complications.As I will describe later, we must be a recognized voice in establishing the effectiveness of our current procedures and new technologies, and the Registry will help us accomplish this. Carotid stenting, renal stenting, and lower extremity revascularization are in the CMS spotlight. Through the Registry initiative, the SVS and its members have a great opportunity to help influence Medicare coverage decisions.SVS will facilitate training of more vascular surgeons to meet increasing demands for vascular careAn objective of the SVS is to facilitate training of more vascular surgeons to meet the increasing demands for vascular care in the growing population of elderly patients. Previously, the SVS leadership recognized the changes that were occurring in our specialty and created new resident training paradigms. The 0-5 program allows students to enter vascular surgery directly from medical school and gives the trainees more time to learn the skills required to practice contemporary vascular surgery and spend less time in training.I will comment on three components of the SVS action plan.Workforce studyNone of us is under the illusion that this it will be easy to expand the number of trainees. First, we need to justify increasing the number of vascular surgeons by carrying out a workforce study. This will be one of the assignments for the Clinical Practice Council, chaired by Bruce Perler.Facilitate developing new training programs and expanding number of trainees in current programsThe SVS will aim to expand the number of trainees in current vascular programs in collaboration with the Association of Program Directors in Vascular Surgery (APDVS) and their president Joe Mills. Also, an SVS work group chaired by Joann Lohr will help high-volume and high quality vascular practices write applications to the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education to create new vascular surgery fellowship programs.Increase awareness by medical students and residents and increase recruiting of good people into trainingWe must recruit more good students and residents into training by increasing their awareness of the multifaceted nature of the specialty. We currently have good applicants in increasing numbers; however, we cannot be complacent. We must reach out to medical students and surgical residents early in their training to be sure that they are aware of the rewards of our specialty and realize that vascular surgery gives them flexible training opportunities, including the 0-5 program, the traditional 5-2 program, and other options in between.There are two effective SVS strategies to recruit trainees. First, Clem Darling and his committee have provided 55 scholarships this year for medical students and residents to attend our annual meeting and have organized an excellent program for them. I encourage the regional vascular surgery societies to do the same. Also, medical students and residents have a newsletter from the SVS, a section on VascularWeb, and podcasts. Second, evidence documents that a major determinant of the career choices of young doctors is stimulation from mentors. You don't have to be in university practice to volunteer to mentor a student. This year, let's all agree to mentor one medical student or resident and show them the excitement that we have experienced from vascular practice.SVS will be the authoritative voice on vascular diseaseAn objective of the SVS is to become the authoritative voice on vascular disease to patients, the medical profession, regulatory bodies, legislators, and payers.Institute of Medicine publicationEarlier this year, the Institute for Medicine (IOM) of the National Academies of Sciences, published a report entitled \u201cKnowing What Works in Health Care.\u201dThey noted that health care costs would be lower if we knew which health care services were effective and which patients were most likely to benefit.Determining effectiveness of treatment is not a new concept. The IOM proposes to have authoritative bodies carry out systematic reviews of existing research studies and develop evidence-based clinical practice guidelines. Contributions by specialty medical societies, like the SVS, will be very important. At this stage it is unclear how this information will be implemented, but the SVS has a trusted relationship with payers and legislators and is in an excellent position to provide input on the full spectrum of vascular treatment.SVS plansWe are the experts on vascular disease and can demonstrate our ownership of vascular disease by standardizing reporting nomenclature, publishing authoritative guidelines on what constitutes best practice for the management of the vascular patient, and actively assessing the effectiveness of management. The Clinical Practice Council, chaired by Bruce Perler and the Research Council, chaired by Rick Powell, are coordinating four action plans.Standardizing reporting nomenclatureOf basic importance in reporting results and comparing treatments is using standardized reporting nomenclature. This effort is chaired by Jim McKinsey.Practice guidelinesA committee chaired by Enrico Ascher is writing practice guidelines for the management of our most common vascular diseases based on the best available clinical evidence. Our carotid disease and renal dialysis access guidelines are in press and more will follow. These guidelines will be a very important basis for judging effectiveness of treatment.RegistryI previously mentioned the importance of our registry in helping us assess the effectiveness of carotid stenting and carotid endarterectomy and determining the subgroups of patients that are most likely to benefit. As we expand the registry to include lower extremity, renal, other areas, our visibility and respect from regulatory agencies including CMS will increase further. With your help, the quality and influence of the Vascular Registry will make us proud that we created it.Performance goals for evaluating new technologyTo evaluate the effectiveness of new treatments, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has encouraged professional groups to develop performance standards for typical therapies against which new devices can be evaluated expeditiously.The Clinical Research Committee, chaired by Mike Conte, will establish expected results for treating critical limb ischemia by analyzing data from existing randomized clinical trials. The effectiveness of a new device, drug, or biological for treating lower extremity ischemia can then be compared to this dataset. From this comparison, the FDA can determine if the new treatment has met an adequate level of safety and reasonable efficacy and can approve it for market promptly.To some, writing these SVS documents and involvement in assessment of the effectiveness of treatment may seem to be only of academic interest. However, determining effectiveness and publishing practice guidelines will raise the standard of patient care. In addition, the SVS and vascular surgeons will become the recognized authorities for best vascular practice. When effectiveness of treatment becomes a determinant for reimbursement, by continuing to establish our much-respected relationship with regulatory agencies, we will be consulted.SVS will be an influential voice to congress and regulatory agenciesThe final major objective of the SVS is to continue to be an influential voice to Congress and regulatory agencies on vascular health care issues, including reimbursement.Let me begin by presenting the challenges that physicians face in the current US health care environment, from a Canadian's perspective.The health care environmentThere is no perfect health care system. Worldwide, the challenges in health care are threefold\u2014economic, ethical, and political.Economic challengesAt the present time, every nation faces common problems in trying to allocate resources for health care in a way that is both equitable and efficient. Indeed, the health care economist Victor Fuchs wrote that all nations face the question \u201cWho shall live?\u201d Hence, based on how much money is spent, each nation defines its own death rate.Very soon, economic factors in the United States will mandate major changes in the health care system, including implementation of a universal health care system. There are three economic realities. Today, health care accounts for more than one in every seven dollars spent in the US economy. The number of Americans without insurance now is 47 million or 15% of the population. The competitive edge of American industry is being weakened because industry bears a large burden of health care costs.Ethical challengesIn my view, inequities in health care delivery can only be solved if we agree on the ethical principle that we must be just and fair to all. This can be met only by having universal health care \u2013 specifically, having access to basic health care for every citizen. History records that the stability of a society depends upon the extent to which the members of that society feel that they are being treated justly. When some of society's members come to feel that they are subject to unequal treatment, the foundations have been laid for social unrest.Political challengesAs the late Dr Michael DeBakey pointed out to Congress in accepting his Congressional Medal, the US government has been discussing universal health care for several decades. But the present environment is extreme, and I believe that the politicians will soon have no choice but to guarantee that all people can enroll in a basic health care package.I do not think that high-pressure lobby groups can successfully counter the arguments posed by the current economic realities of health care and by the principle that justice and fairness must prevail.The challenge for every society is to allocate health care resources as fairly as possible and to do as much good as possible. As health care resources are reallocated, the SVS needs to position itself to understand what is happening in Washington and to represent the interests of vascular surgeons and our patients.What the SVS has done and will doThe SVS is in a strong position to represent your interests related to reimbursement and coding and federal regulatory and legislative issues because of the trusted relationships that members and staff of the Health Policy Committee, chaired by Bob Zwolak, have established.Over the years, the group has worked to get approval for multiple new Current Procedural Terminology codes and have the Relative Value Update Committee assign them relative value units, which have been positive for vascular surgeons. To comment on the strength of our Health Policy group, I will highlight three major accomplishments:Expense paymentsThe first realization that we could have a direct impact in Washington came in 1997. At that time, SVS faced major reductions in practice expense payments from Medicare. The SVS convinced a number of key Senators and Congressmen that under-represented specialties at the American Medical Association, such as vascular surgery, should have the opportunity to submit their supplemental practice expense data for review. SVS was the first specialty society to submit supplemental data from many members across the country, and our efforts saved millions of dollars of lost income.The Screening Abdominal Aortic Aneurysms Very Efficiently (SAAAVE) ActOur second major legislative victory was passage of the Medicare screening benefit for abdominal aortic aneurysms in 2005. SVS led the National Aneurysm Alliance, which bought the SAAAVE Act to reality in one of the fastest times on record to gain a preventive service benefit for Medicare. Further work is required on the SAAAVE Act.Deficit Reduction ActOur third partial success relates to the Deficit Reduction Act (DRA), which was passed late in December 2005 without hearings and without open consultation with any medical associations. Although no Washington group had ever claimed that ultrasound services were over-paid, ultrasound was included in the DRA. The SVS, aided substantially by the Society for Vascular Ultrasound, mounted a major successful effort for removal of the physiologic studies such as recording pressures and bi-directional blood flow from the DRA and prevented inappropriate loss of tens of millions of dollars per year from vascular laboratories. SVS lobbying will to continue to push Congress to refocus the DRA on advanced imaging such as magnetic resonance imaging and computed tomography and remove duplex studies from the budget cuts; for example, Medicare payments for carotid duplex examinations fell by almost $82 million dollars per year, and much of that loss was absorbed by vascular surgeons.In summary, Congress and key government agencies including CMS and FDA have recognized that the SVS is an important advisory on vascular health care issues and will continue to welcome our input. SVS will continue to leverage this influence.Ensuring future success of SVSOver the past 5 years since Jack Cronenwett and Tom Riles orchestrated our merger, the SVS has matured and now represents the independent specialty of vascular surgery. But it takes more than a statement of goals and a work plan to be successful. The future success of the SVS and vascular surgery is certain because the SVS has the following internal characteristics and has a successful organization.Internal characteristicsSVS members have always been committed, but having merged together, we now clearly show the following five characteristics.VolunteerismThis year, more than 200 members have volunteered their time to the SVS. I have been impressed how our volunteers have put aside their personal agendas and dogma in order to work towards improving our specialty. Our member's volunteerism in Iraq, is described in Ruth Bush's paper, and is further testament to a willingness to be involved.We listenCommunication is a two way process. The SVS receives input from each of the regional vascular societies who have a seat on the SVS Board of Directors. In order to understand the environment and needs of our members, we welcome input from the Women's Issues Committee chaired by Cynthia Shortell, the Diversity Committee chaired by Chris Kwolek, the recently formed the Young Surgeons Advisory Group chaired Niten Singh and the Private Practice Advisory Group chaired by Russell Samson.ProfessionalismThe SVS abides by the core values of professionalism, commitment, and integrity. As a mature society, we have a responsibility to uphold these values and to review complaints against a member related to unprofessional conduct such as false advertising, unscrupulous business practices, or fraudulent expert witness testimony. The Professional Conduct Committee, chaired by Keith Calligaro, has reviewed and resolved two such complaints.TransparencyTransparency in our appointment process is now well established. The SVS can no longer be accused of nepotism. In making appointments to committees, we announce the vacancies and ask members to volunteer and submit a short personal statement. Decisions are made by the President, President-Elect, and Vice President, with input from the Executive Director, and decisions are based on a balance of the personal statements, gender, diversity and geography\u2014not favoritism.InclusivenessThe SVS is inclusive. The SVS started as an academic society and indeed still recognizes major academic contributions of members by appointment to our category of \u201cDistinguished Fellow of the SVS.\u201d We are reaching out to welcome all vascular surgeons from within North America and beyond. This year we have 237 applications for membership. The International Relations Committee, chaired by Greg Sicard, awarded five scholarships to permit young vascular surgeons from outside North America to attend our annual meeting and visit several North American centers. This year, we established the first International Chapter of the SVS in India, and we look forward to the formation of chapters in China, Brazil, and elsewhere.Organization is strongThe SVS organization is also strong:AdministrationOur administrative staff lead by Becky Maron is outstanding and works collaboratively with our volunteers.BudgetWe have a suitable operating budget of $5.5 million from royalties from theJVS, contributions from our corporate partners, and member's dues. In particular we acknowledge the support of our platinum corporate sponsors.Strategic plansThe strategic plans I described are feasible. We have well defined plans of action that will re-establish vascular surgery's preeminent identity in treating vascular disease and will make our member's lives better.ConclusionsI have described the challenges that we will face in the future. We should be optimistic and see opportunities in these challenges. I believe that the future of the vascular surgery is positive.The face of vascular surgery started changing a decade ago when SVS leaders recognized the importance of endovascular surgery, emphasized retraining of our members and changed resident training to include the 0-5 program so that residents could spend less time in training and focus on vascular management.Five years ago, the Society for Vascular Surgery\u2013American Association for Vascular Surgery merger further changed the face of the specialty by allowing vascular surgeons to speak with one voice. Now we have a logical strategic plan to take us into the future. The three major goals identified by the SVS Board of Directors are (1) to promote the independent identity of vascular surgery, (2) to advance comprehensive vascular care, and (3) to be the recognized voice for vascular surgeons. These goals are not merely an intellectual illusion. The SVS has realistic objectives and action plans to accomplish each goal.Vascular surgery is regaining its independent identity. We are the only group that can provide comprehensive vascular patient care. And the SVS will be the recognized voice for vascular care.It has been my please to present this \u201cState of the Society\u201d address on behalf of all the volunteers\u2014past, present and future\u2014who have developed a mature society and an independent specialty. These are great times for the SVS and vascular surgery.",
  "2009": "It has been traditional over the past few years to use the Presidential Address to give an update on Society for Vascular Surgery (SVS) activities \u2013 in other words, to provide a \u201cstate of the union\u201d address and to tell you what's gone on during my watch. I am going to depart from that tradition for two reasons. The first is that there is a superb treatise on the scope of SVS activities and programs published in the December 2008 issue of theJournal of Vascular Surgeryby our past President, Wayne Johnston.I urge you to read this. Wayne outlines SVS programs in the context of strategic initiatives that were determined by the SVS Board of Directors last year. I think that you will be impressed with the multitude of SVS activities that are designed to serve you, the membership. Our councils and their committees are bursting with activity and over 270 SVS members volunteer their time in serving on these committees.I would like to emphasize two themes of Wayne's report. The first is that the SVS is making continued efforts to reach out to the entire vascular community, including international members, vascular technologists, vascular physicians' assistants, nurses, and, most recently, podiatrists. We want to become a diverse and comprehensive organization that represents all in the vascular surgery community. Second, the process for council and committee appointments has been revamped to make this a democratic process. When there are committee vacancies, we send out RFAs asking for your interest in committee assignments, and we appoint on the basis of expertise and availability, not on \u201cwho you know.\u201d In my opinion, this process has dramatically strengthened the effectiveness of our SVS committees. So, watch your e-mail for these requests.The second reason for departing from the traditional address is that I have become increasingly concerned about the cost of vascular intervention. I think that this is reaching a crisis state that will have an impact on the way in which we practice. While I am concerned that vascular surgery may cost too much, let me be clear in stating unequivocally that vascular surgeons are the best bargain available when it comes to treating vascular disease. That is because we practice all modalities including medical, endoluminal, and open surgical treatment of vascular disorders. Unlike others, we are not wed to a single approach in treating our patients. This makes vascular surgeons uniquely qualified to determine what are the most effective and the least expensive treatments available. Furthermore, it is better that we make these determinations rather than having a governmental agency or private insurer determine or dictate this for us.There are several looming, external threats driving health care cost concerns. Our economy is in bad shape, we are in a recession, and the federal deficit is ever increasing. Estimates from the Congressional Budget Office project the federal deficit to exceed two trillion dollars for 2009. If you go online to the National Debt Clock, the estimate is over 10 trillion.The real problem is that health care costs are sky-rocketing and are a major factor in driving the national debt.Total US health care spending is expected to double to 4.3 trillion dollars by 2017 (). Per capita spending will increase from approximately 4000 to 13,000 dollars per person per year over the next decade ().Federal spending for health care, which includes Medicare and Medicaid, is approximately 50% of all health expenditures. Federal funding will also double from 800 billion to a little less than 2 trillion dollars in the next decade. By 2017, Medicare spending is expected to rise to 884 billion dollars and this will be one fifth of all national health care spending.It is hard to \u201cwrap one's head\u201d around these numbers and it is helpful to look at health care expenditures as a percent of the gross domestic product or the total wealth of our national economy. This is a complicated graph from an influential article that appeared in Health Affairs in 2008(). The solid blue line represents the rate of growth in national health care spending. This remains relatively stable at roughly 6% per year. The red line represents the GDP growth rate that has \u201ctaken a hit,\u201d with a drop in 2007. The light blue bars show the proportion of the GDP taken by health care spending. Currently, we are at 17% of the GDP and this is expected to rise to about 20% in the next decade. However, I think that these are underestimates because this research was published in 2008, before our economy tanked. Because the red line has decreased even more than shown in the graph, the real percentage of health care spending expressed as a percent of GDP may be much higher. These levels of health care spending are simply not sustainable.Health care costs are eating up a huge proportion of the federal budget. By 2018, Medicare and federal Medicaid costs will consume one third of federal spending (). Along with Social Security, these federal expenditures will, by necessity, reduce funding for other prominent, federal entitlement programs. Because entitlement programs have strong grassroots support and congressional advocates, it is predictable that the \u201centitlement squeeze\u201d will become very political.It is commonly thought that the arrival of baby boomers into the Medicare beneficiary pool will drive a lot of these increasing costs. To some extent that is true, but this is only a modest fraction of projected overall health costs.Of course, this fraction is located squarely in the Medicare pool of patients, and the increase there will have a major impact on future CMS budgets.As for total health care costs, the major factors driving up the costs are known as \u201cutilization\u201d and \u201cmedical prices\u201das shown in the red and blue portions of the bars on this graph (). Loosely translated, these costs have to do with the way that physicians practice, how they charge, how frequently they admit patients to hospitals, and how they prescribe medicines and use expensive medical devices. These areas will be major targets of health care policy reformers.There is huge variation in health care spending among countries in the civilized world and the United States spends more than any other nation.Unfortunately, this does not necessarily translate into better health outcomes. This graph plots per capita spending vs life expectancy (). The United States leads the pack in terms of health care spending but enjoys an average life expectancy equivalent to Cuba, which spends a fraction as much on health care.Looking within our own borders, there is huge regional variation in health care spending in the United States. These are data from the Dartmouth Atlas of Health Care 2008,and they show the ratio of state to national Medicare spending across all states for patients with nine chronically ill conditions, one of which is peripheral vascular disease (). The data are adjusted for age, gender, race, illness severity, and other factors that might influence health care utilization. The deep blue and light blue states such as California, New York, and Texas, my own state, are above average and relatively expensive for Medicare compared with grey and green states such as Oklahoma and Iowa.Do higher spending levels result in better outcomes? The resounding answer is no. In numerous studies, Dartmouth health researchers have documented a troubling paradox; higher spending is actually associated with lower quality of care and slightly worse outcomes.How can this be? This graph plots the number of cardiologists per 100,000 population on the x-axis vs number of visits to cardiologists on the y-axis (). More cardiologists beget more visits and referrals with more testing and interventions that may not be helpful, and ultimately may be harmful.In our own specialty, this map shows the rate of aortic aneurysm repair among different regions(). There are some aneurysm \u201chot spots\u201d around the country, but there are no known differences in the incidence of aortic aneurysms among these regions, and there are no decreased rates of ruptured aneurysms in these areas. In addition, the rate of death from aneurysm is the same, or even slightly higher, than in regions with a comparatively low rate of aneurysm repair. This may simply be due to a higher rate of intervention with attendant morbidity and mortality. These and other variations in CMS expenditures with no improvement in outcomes and, possibly, worse outcomes, are raising tremendous concern among federal health policy makers.Our new administration has promised health care reform as a centerpiece among their ambitious initiatives (). In addition to health care costs, the President has promised to take on the problem of the 47 million US citizens who are uninsured or under-insured and lack access to basic health care. Thus, change is truly on the way, although we do not yet have a clear idea what that change will be. However, rest assured that health care cost containment is a major component.Comparative effectiveness research has been a buzz word among health policy wonks in Washington for the past 5 years or so,and this has developed major traction in the Obama administration. Comparative effectiveness research simply compares two treatments with the goal of determining which is most effective.One may compare medical treatments, medical vs surgical or other interventional treatments, surgical vs catheter-based interventions, or even diagnostic modalities. As many of you know, a significant \u201cchunk\u201d of money, or 1.1 billion dollars from President Obama's multibillion dollar Economic Stimulus Package, is going to the NIH, the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, or AHRQ, and the Department of Health and Human Services specifically for comparative effectiveness research. There is even talk of a Comparative Effectiveness Research Institute with legislation introduced by Senator Baucus last year.When I first heard of comparative effectiveness research, my first thought was that this is \u201crediscovering the wheel\u201d. We have been doing this for years: CREST, NASCET, ACAS, and OVER are just a few examples of trials in the vascular community that are basic \u201ccomparative effectiveness research.\u201d But what may be different in these trials and current comparative effectiveness initiatives is the added feature of cost effectiveness analysis.There are those who argue that comparative effectiveness research and cost-effectiveness analyses are two separate and distinct disciplines. However, I think that the two are inextricably bound. For example, if one compares two treatments and finds that treatment A is only modestly better than treatment B but costs ten times more, it would seem reasonable to use treatment B for most patients. However, if treatment A is vastly more superior to treatment B, one may be willing to incur the added expense. So, whether explicitly stated or not, comparative effectiveness research has clear economic implications. One of the main reasons the federal government is promoting comparative effectiveness research is the belief that it would reduce variation in practice and, thereby, save money.Research on comparative effectiveness has been integrated into health care systems in other developed countries including Australia, Canada, Britain, France, and Germany. Perhaps the best known is Britain's National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence that goes by the ironic acronym of \u201cNICE.\u201d NICE is an independent government-funded organization that advises the British National Health Service. It does not sponsor clinical trials or other forms of primary data collection. Instead, it funds meta-analyses of existing research and combines this with cost-effectiveness analyses.Since its inception in 1999, decisions from NICE have generated a great deal of controversy.Of the 159 decisions handed down by NICE up to 2008, approximately one third have been appealed and a little less than half of these appeals have been upheld. NICE has been variously viewed as a heartless, governmental rationing agency or an honest attempt to prioritize health care with the goal of providing the most effective treatments for greatest number of British citizens at the lowest cost.In February of this year, NICE came out with endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) recommendations.It is notable and laudable that NICE consulted with prominent British vascular surgeons in their deliberations. As I interpret this document, EVAR is recommended for patients who are able to undergo open surgery and is not recommended for \u201cunfit\u201d patients and those with ruptured aneurysms. Thus, these recommendations roughly parallel the findings and conclusions of the UK EVAR 1 and 2 Trials. Many of us in the United States would take exception to these recommendations and would even go as far to say that EVAR has its greatest benefit in patients who cannot tolerate open surgery and those with ruptured aneurysms.Many are concerned that a similar US Comparative Effectiveness Research Institute would mandate treatment decisions and thereby reduce physicians' autonomy.At its worst, this is a \u201cone size fits all\u201d mentality that devalues treatment decisions for unusual or special circumstances in which a treatment might be successful even if it is outside of \u201cofficial guidelines.\u201d The proponents of federal comparative effectiveness research point out that the process will be transparent, scholarly, and persuasive; will involve all stakeholders; and will be designed to promote best practices by gaining the respect of the medical community. In other words, \u201cbuy-in\u201d from practicing physicians is necessary for the success of this approach.However, in one document prepared by the Congressional Budget Office, the author states, \u201cTo\u2026reduce health care spending in a meaningful way, the results of comparative effectiveness analyses would\u2026have to be used in ways that changed the behavior of doctors\u2026For example, the higher value care identified by comparative effectiveness research could be promoted\u2026through financial incentives \u2013 that is, payments to doctors\u2026\u201d.I do not know about you, but this sounds to me like coercion akin to \u201cpay for performance.\u201dWhat is the role of the SVS in all of this? Well, we have some of the tools to carry out comparative effectiveness research. I say some because we are not in the position to sponsor major, randomized clinical trials. However, we have Practice Guidelines and Reporting Standards. Some are published and others are in the pipeline to be published in theJournal of Vascular Surgery. These are important because they provide a framework based on careful, systematic and scholarly analyses that promote best practices. We also have a growing Vascular Registry developed by the SVS Outcomes Committee.The SVS Carotid Registry has been eminently successful and presented an important paper at our annual meeting last year.This, in essence, is a report on comparative effectiveness that compares carotid endarterectomy to carotid angioplasty/stenting. The Outcomes Committee has also partnered with the New England Research Institute in responding to an NIH Challenge Grant on Comparative Effectiveness. The plan is to use SVS carotid registry data in comparing medical vs interventional treatment, including CAS and CEA, in the treatment of asymptomatic carotid stenosis.The Outcomes Committee also has plans to expand the registry to include lower extremity interventions for critical limb ischemia, thoracic dissections and other catastrophic thoracic aortic problems, and, possibly, angioaccess. Prospective registry data are key ingredients in analyzing outcomes as well as costs. I urge you to consider joining SVS Registry modules as they become available.Not only do we have the tools, we have the brain power, talent, and drive to carry out this research. The Clinical Practice Council has developed a Comparative Effectiveness Task Force. They have already produced a \u201cwhite paper\u201d or position statement that spells out our plans for comparative effectiveness research that will include cost efficacy analyses.One of their first undertakings will be a systematic review of treatments for intermittent claudication that will focus on outcomes, durability, quality of life, and costs. Medical or exercise therapy compared with intervention will be the main topic. There are at least three, recent randomized on this topic with conflicting conclusions.These and other reports will comprise a data base for a meta-analysis. A recent article from the New York Times has already mentioned this as a target for federal comparative effectiveness research stating, \u201cHow do drugs and watchful waiting compare with surgery as a treatment for leg pain that results from blockage of the arteries in the lower legs?\u201dThere are many other areas that we can assess. For example, is EVAR really the best treatment for a relatively healthy person less than 65 years old who may have expected longevity of 20 years or more? Existing data would suggest that EVAR is more expensive, is associated with many more re-interventions, has inferior quality of life, has no survival advantage in the long-term and may, in fact, have poorer long-term survival.Other areas in vascular disease treatment ripe for comparative effectiveness research include \u201cendo first\u201d vs distal bypass for critical limb ischemia; medical vs interventional treatment for asymptomatic carotid disease; angioplasty vs bypass for superficial femoral artery disease; IVC filters vs pharmaco-mechanical prophylaxis for patients at high risk for venous thromboembolism, and many others.Why should the Society for Vascular Surgery take on comparative effectiveness research? First, this would be looked on favorably by government agencies such as CMS and, if properly done, might be accepted without further interference. This is a polite way of saying that it is far better that we do it ourselves instead of AHRQ or some other federal agency doing it for us. Second, as mentioned earlier, of all specialty groups treating patients with vascular disease, we are the most unbiased because we practice all modalities; that is, we are not wed to one approach. Thus, we are best positioned of all to do this. Third, we have the expertise and the will to carry out high quality comparative effectiveness research.Finally, these mandates are clearly spelled out in our Mission Statement, to: \u201cClearly define the role of surgery, endovascular surgery and medical treatment and prevention of vascular disease\u201d and to \u201cAddress social, economic, ethical, and legal issues that relate to vascular surgery.\u201d INTEGRITY is our middle name. This is the right thing to do for our membership, for our patients, and for the public.In a memorable SVS Presidential Address in 1994, Norman Hertzer challenged the vascular surgical community to develop mechanisms for formal outcomes assessment.As Norm stated, \u201cResults mean everything\u201d. To this, I would add: compared to what? \u2013 and, at what price?",
  "2010": "It is with great honor that I stand before you today as the President of the Society for Clinical Vascular Surgery, the second largest vascular surgery society. The SCVS is very special; although it is a national society with the advantage of meeting members from all over the United States, it has the feel of a regional society in that you get to know many of the members and you look forward to seeing them from one meeting to another. I am most grateful to the members of the Executive Council, Program Committee, and administrative staff of this Society, who worked tirelessly to make this year\u2019s symposium one of the most successful meetings. To do so, we built on the accomplishments of the past Presidents, a distinguished group of vascular surgeons. I am proud and honored to become a member of their exclusive club and call them friends.Recently, I became very interested in the Pay for Performance (P4P) initiative of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS); what is going on in Washington regarding P4P not only is important to understand, but is also very interesting to watch. The interaction among government agencies, health care consumers, patients\u2019 advocate organizations, insurance companies, and provider organizations is a microcosm of the workings of the government.By addressing this topic, I aim to heighten our specialty\u2019s interest in P4P, hoping that our involvement will lead to programs that are clinically pertinent as well as patient centered. This address is divided into four segments: the current reimbursement system, which encourages volume inflation without regard to measuring quality; the P4P efforts of governmental agencies and private organizations; outcome measurements, probably the most important step in the P4P process; and the current status of funding of this initiative. At the end, I offer my concerns and recommendations as the P4P process evolves and matures.Current reimbursement systemLast year, 2005, marked the 40th anniversary of the Medicare and Medicaid law that President Lyndon Johnson signed on July 30, 1965. Currently, over 42 million seniors and disabled persons take advantage of this national system for most of their health care needs. Although CMS pay for physicians, hospitals, and other medical services, it is physicians\u2019 reimbursement issues that I would like to discuss. The physician reimbursement system, which was once based on what was known as customary, prevailing, and reasonable charges, well compensated procedure-oriented specialties such as surgery. That system was felt to be inequitable and inflationary. In 1992, Medicare instituted the resource-based relative value scale (RBRVS), significantly changing the way physicians are paid. The RBRVS, the brainchild of William Hsiao, a professor of economics at Harvard University, aimed to decrease payment for procedure-oriented specialties and increase it for those specialties considered to be \u201ccognitive\u201d in nature, leading to the prediction at the time that this new system would increase reimbursement for those specialties by over 50%.The RBRVS includes \u201crelative values\u201d for each Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) code based on estimates of the amount of physician work, practice cost, and medical liability premium costs involved. Each of these components is geographically adjusted and then multiplied by a conversion factor that translates the total unit value for the CPT code into a dollar amount.The value of the conversion factor is determined by CMS on an annual basis by using a complex formula defined by federal statute that reflects Medicare\u2019s inflation rate (known as the Medicare Economic Index, or MEI) and an \u201cadjustment factor\u201d based on the Sustainable Growth Rate (SGR). The SGR was created by Congress in 1999 to control Medicare spending on physicians\u2019 services. It sets expenditure targets that take into account the number of fee-for-service Medicare beneficiaries and the nation\u2019s overall economic growth. If total physician spending exceeds the spending target set by SGR, a negative adjustment of up to \u22127% is applied to the MEI when the conversion factor is updated each year. Conversely, if total spending is below the SGR, a bonus of up to 3% may be applied to the MEI. The problem with SGR is that it attempts at the same time to set prices for individual services while controlling total Medicare spending. These two goals can very seldom be accomplished simultaneously because as the number of Medicare beneficiaries increases and the services provided to them get more complex and costly, the total spending for Medicare part B expands. To control this expansion in Medicare spending, reimbursement for individual services, as reflected by the value of the conversion factor, has to drop in order to meet SGR targets. The Medicare Payment Advisory Commission (MedPAC) warned in its report to Congress (to the Subcommittee on Health of the Committee on Ways and Means of the House of Representatives) as early as 2002 that this method used to determine the value of the conversion factor is flawed, recommended that Congress repeal SGR, and predicted 4 years of negative impact on the value of the conversion factor if this system was not repealed.MedPAC\u2019s predictions were right on target; the value of the conversion factor was supposed to decrease on an annual basis for a total decrease of 8.7% from 2003 to 2005. Under pressure from physicians\u2019 and surgeons\u2019 groups, Congress reversed this trend every single year, increasing the value of the conversion factor by 4.5% in the same time period. Similarly, for 2006, the conversion factor was supposed to decrease by 4.4%; again Congress reversed it and froze the value at the 2005 level. In addition, the Government Accounting Office (GAO) projects that the conversion factor will continue its decline on an average of 4% to 5% per year over the next 5 years if the SGR law is not repealed by Congress, a total of 20% drop by 2010 (). MedPAC and GAO predictions were validated by the just-released Medicare Trustees report of 2006, which projects that physician payments will be cut 4.7% in 2007 and that payment rates would have to be reduced by 4% to 5% each year through at least 2015.If the increase in practice costs and inflation are factored in, the problem is even more amplified. MedPAC\u2019s report noted that this projected decrease in physician reimbursement would have a negative impact on Medicare beneficiaries\u2019 access to health care and recommended controlling total Medicare spending, not only physician reimbursement. The American Medical Association (AMA) predicted that this projected decrease in physician reimbursement will have a profound effect on Medicare beneficiaries. The results of an AMA-conducted survey indicated that if Medicare payments are cut by 5% beginning in 2007, 45% of physicians plan either to decrease (29%) or to stop (16%) the number of new Medicare patients they accept, 20% may be forced to reduce the number of established patients they treat, 42% plan to discontinue nursing home visits, 37% of physicians whose practices serve a rural area will discontinue these services, and 71% will make one or more significant changes in the care of their patients, including reducing time spent with Medicare patients, referring complex cases, or discontinuing certain services.The results of this survey confirm the fears of MedPAC regarding Medicare beneficiaries\u2019 access to quality health care. One of the solutions proposed by GAO was to replace SGR with fee updates based on MEI; it was estimated that if the change were to take place, fee updates would be in the range of 2.1% to 2.4% from 2006 to 2014 instead of the projected drop.Obviously, this system, which is intended to control volume and cost, perversely creates incentives to increase volume; if physician reimbursement continues to drop and Congress does not interfere on an annual basis to reverse the negative updates in the conversion factor, physicians may respond by increasing volume to make up for the decrease in their income. This prediction was also made by MedPAC report of 2002:\u201cAn expenditure target approach, such as the SGR, assumes that increasing updates if overall volume is controlled, and decreasing updates if overall volume is not controlled, provides physicians a collective incentive to control the volume of services. However, this assumption is incorrect because people do not respond to collective incentives but individual incentives \u2026. If anything, in the short run an individual physician has an incentive to increase volume under such a system and the sum of those individual incentives will result in an increase in volume overall.\u201dA system that encourages volume inflation is a flawed system, and many, including the American College of Surgeons (ACS), called for repealing SGR. Congress has also been concerned that this system encourages volume inflation without rewarding quality.Pay for performanceUnder congressional pressure, CMS has been hard at work to find ways to reward quality, placing enormous efforts in the P4P concept, also calledvalue-based purchasing. CMS is even promoting its own P4P mottos: \u201cThe right care for every patient every time\u201d or \u201cPayment is traditionally determined by what was donetoa patient; P4P will allow payment to be determined by what is donefora patient.\u201d P4P is not a new concept; in its current form, P4P has been used by businesses to improve quality and efficiency. Various P4P schemes include offering bonuses in addition to regular salary or withholding part of the salary and allowing the employee to earn it back as a reward for increased efficiency, quality, or productivity. Such reward should be of a sufficient value in order to result in the intended change in behavior, and its application should be simple enough to be understood by the employee and to allow ease in implementation and monitoring.However, P4P may have unintended consequences; for example, if only efficiency is rewarded, quality may suffer. Similarly, in nonmedical fields, good performance may equate with improved profits, perhaps without emphasis on quality. When P4P models are used in the medical and surgical fields, however, most think of performance in terms of improved quality as represented by improved outcomes.I would like to state at the outset that very few peer-reviewed publications can be found to support this approach. A recently published article inJAMAthat examined data on three performance outcome measures (cervical cancer screening, mammography, and hemoglobin A1ctesting) concluded: \u201cPaying clinicians to reach a common, fixed performance target may produce little gain in quality for the money spent and will largely reward those with higher performance at baseline.\u201d Those above the target threshold feel that what they need to do is keep the status quo to get the performance bonus. In addition, the authors speculated that the performance bonus was too modest, at 5% annually, to result in a significant behavior change.However, despite the absence of appropriate research validating the merits of P4P, the process is not slowing down.Monitoring the results and outcomes of surgery is not new to this specialty. Surgery has always monitored its results, and its members have long submitted themselves to public critique by peers and colleagues in mortality and morbidity conferences on a weekly or monthly basis. As early as the 1900s, Ernest Codman vigorously championed the idea of reporting results against the opposition of the medical establishment in his State of Massachusetts. In 1908 Codman stated: \u201cEvery hospital should follow every patient it treats long enough to determine whether or not the treatment had been successful and then to inquire, if not, why not?\u201d However, Dr Codman\u2019s efforts were appreciated and their benefits were realized long after his death.The concept of hospital standardization, Dr Codman proposed in the ACS clinical congress of 1912, led to the formation of the Joint Commission of Accreditation of Hospitals in 1952, which became the present-day Joint Commission of Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations (JCAHO).Although surgery has long monitored its own results primarily by using the mortality and morbidity format, cumulative results and outcomes on a surgeon, hospital, state, or national level have not been collected except for those high-visibility key procedures such as cardiac surgery. For over two decades now, there has been a concern that the government has been spending an enormous amount of money on the Medicare and Medicaid programs without an appreciable return on quality. However, what brought this issue to the forefront and increased the awareness of the public to the issue of quality and patient safety are two documents produced by the Institute of Medicine that received enormous levels of publicity. These two documents identified the problem of in-hospital medical errors and attempted to propose solutions for it.To Err is Human, which was published in 2000, estimated that 98,000 patients die annually in American hospitals not as a consequence of their disease, but because of medical errors.This publication highlighted the importance of improving health care delivery systems. It also called for patients\u2019 involvement in their own care as a protective mechanism to detect and avoid such mistakes. One of the recommendations made to improve patient safety was improving data collection and analysis.Published a year later,Crossing the Quality Chasmrecommended that \u201call health care organizations, professional groups, and private and public purchasers pursue six major aims; specifically, \u201chealth care should be safe, effective, patient-centered, timely, efficient, and equitable.\u201d To do so, this document suggested performance expectations for the American health care system aligning the incentives of reimbursement and accountability with improvement of quality targets.Frustrated by the seemingly slow progress of the efforts to institute performance measurement, the Institute of Medicine produced another landmark document in January 2006 entitledPerformance Measurement: Accelerating Improvement.This report, which was produced by a committee at the Institute of Medicine at the request of Congress, focuses on selecting measures to support quality-improvement efforts. It is the first report in what is known as thePathways to Quality Health Careseries, which will also include payment incentives and quality-improvement initiatives. This committee recommended that Congress establish a National Quality Coordination Board funded by the Medicare Trust Fund to oversee the development of performance measures and their implementation.Surgical Care Improvement ProjectFor over a decade now,CMS has been promoting improved quality and efficiency by contracting with Quality Improvement Organizations to monitor and improve quality of health care delivery to Medicare beneficiaries in various states. CMS aimed to demonstrate the effect of incentives on improved quality by partnering with Premier Inc, a nationwide organization of not-for-profit hospitals. The participation of Premier hospitals in this project was voluntary. This demonstration program was launched on March 13, 2003. Thirty-four quality measures in five acute clinical areas were tested. These areas included acute myocardial infarction, coronary artery bypass graft, heart failure, community-acquired pneumonia, and hip and knee replacement surgery. CMS aimed to reward top-performing hospitals by increasing their payment for Medicare beneficiaries. For the top decile hospitals, the bonus will be 2% of the Diagnosis-Related Group\u2013based prospective payment for the patients in the measured condition for all Medicare fee-for-service beneficiaries. Hospitals in the second decile will be paid a bonus incentive of 1% of the Diagnosis-Related Group\u2013based prospective payment amount. Over 100 Premier hospitals participate in this demonstration project.Although surgery was not an early focus of CMS efforts in the P4P area, through a steering committee formed by a collaboration of 10 national organizations including the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ), the ACS, CMS, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the Surgical Care Improvement Project (SCIP) was born. This project was developed as an extension of the Surgical Infection Prevention program, which aimed to reduce perioperative infection by timely and appropriate use of antibiotic prophylaxis. SCIP is based on the premise that a good number of the complications in over 40 million operations performed annually in the United States can be avoided by appropriate perioperative care. In fact, SCIP\u2019s general aim is to reduce surgical morbidity and mortality by 25% by the year 2010.To do so, SCIP\u2019s specific goals are to reduce the incidence of:1Surgical site infection.2Perioperative adverse cardiac events.3Venous thromboembolic events.4Postoperative respiratory complications.To monitor the implementation of the above goals, specific outcome measures were put in place. For example, to monitor timely and appropriate antibiotic coverage, the following measures were to be implemented:1Prophylactic antibiotic received within 1 hour prior to surgical incision.2Appropriate prophylactic antibiotic selection for surgical patients.3Prophylactic antibiotics discontinued within 24 hours after surgery end time (48 hours for cardiac patients).Such outcome measures are to be monitored, and institutions that are in compliance will be financially rewarded. Various states\u2019 Quality Improvement Organizations contracted with CMS to recruit physicians and hospitals to implement SCIP. Quality Improvement Organizations have also worked on developing data collection systems and test their usability, in addition to providing administrative support in some instances. However, implementation of a fully mature P4P model is not immediate, and actual P4P will probably be implemented in 4 to 5 years. Until full maturation of the program, voluntary reporting, pay for reporting, and pay for participation will be implemented. CMS hope that the voluntary and rewarded efforts put in place for reporting and participation would raise the awareness of health care providers and improve the quality of services delivered to Medicare beneficiaries even before the actual implementation of mature P4P programs years later.Physician Voluntary Reporting ProgramHolding itself to the implementation timeline, CMS announced on October 28, 2005, that it would put in place a Physician Voluntary Reporting Program (PVRP) to start at the beginning of 2006. In the notification it published on November 2, 2005, CMS stated that the PVRP is being rolled out as a part of its overall quality-improvement efforts to \u201csubstantially improve the health and function of our beneficiaries by preventing chronic disease complications, avoiding preventable hospitalizations, and improving the quality of care delivered.\u201d The notification went on to state that \u201cCMS is committed to the development of reporting and payment systems that will support and reward quality\u201d and that \u201cthe quality initiatives aim to \u2026 ultimately support new payment systems that provide more financial resources to provide better care, rather than simply paying based on the volume of the service.\u201dIn order for CMS to implement this program, it used the already established administrative system for physicians\u2019 claims. Medicare instituted a group of G-codes (Gforgovernment). These codes are reported along with the CPT codes used to describe the service provided. For example, to report whether an AV dialysis access was performed by using autogenous tissue or prosthetic material, two G-codes were approved: G8081 if the access was autogenous and G8082 if it was not. PVRP originally called for data collection on 36 quality measures. However, the number of measures was revised on December 27, 2005, to include 16 measures only (). Three measures of interest to vascular surgery were retained, including placement of autogenous AV dialysis access, antibiotic prophylaxis in surgical patients, and thromboembolism prophylaxis in surgical patients. Each measure has a numerator (the number of G-codes reported) and a denominator that is specifically defined for each measure. CMS will calculate the percentage rate for each of the measures reported and feed the data back to providers who volunteer to participate. It intends to start in 2006. There has been an objection from the AMA against the use of G-codes by CMS to collect and report data since the CPT includes category II codes that are also intended to report quality. Until now, there has been no final decision on which reporting system to use; initially, a combination of the two may be used. CMS consider reporting by G-codes to be an interim step until more robust systems based on data mining from electronic health records are in more widespread use. Indeed, CMS are in the process of developing prototypes for nationwide health information network architecture in an attempt to move the country toward using personal electronic health records. Recently, Mike Leavitt, Department of Health and Human Services Secretary, announced that his department would be awarding $18.6 million in contracts to four groups or consortia of health care and health information technology organizations to develop such prototypes implementing electronic health records that can follow up consumers throughout their lives. Each group is a partnership between technology developers and health care providers. The idea is that each consortium develops a prototype network for secure information sharing among different health care providers to include physicians, hospitals, laboratories, and pharmacies. In addition, the Department of Health and Human Services is prompting all four groups to work together to ensure that information flows seamlessly among the four networks. Once a system that connects all health care markets matures, CMS and other insurers will have a health care data mining capability that can easily monitor the performance of health care providers throughout the United States.AMA/Physician Consortium for Performance ImprovementTo develop clinically valid and evidence-based quality measures, the AMA formed the Physician Consortium for Performance Improvement. The Consortium, of which the ACS and the Society for Vascular Surgery (SVS) are two of about 70 member organizations, enlists the expertise of physicians and experts on methodology. Its stated mission is \u201cto improve patient health and safety by: identifying and developing evidence-based clinical performance measures that enhance quality of patient care and that foster accountability; promoting the implementation of effective and relevant clinical performance improvement activities; and advancing the science of clinical performance measurement and improvement.\u201d CMS contracts with the Consortium directly or through a third party. Once the proposed performance measures are in place, they are ready to be vetted and endorsed by the National Quality Forum. The Forum, which was incorporated in 1999 in response to the report of the President\u2019s Advisory Commission on Consumer Protection and Quality in Health Care Industry, promotes valid, comparative data needed to improve health care quality.The National Quality Forum is now the organization whose stamp of approval is important to legitimize a performance measure.Ambulatory Care Quality Alliance and Surgical Quality AllianceThe Ambulatory Care Quality Alliance (AQA) emerged as a key player in CMS\u2019 efforts to enlist the support of various organizations for its performance measures. Many organizations belong to AQA: specialty societies, health care purchasers, health care insurers, government agencies, consumer groups, and other quality care experts. AQA was convened in September of 2004 by four organizations: the American Academy of Family Physicians, the American College of Physicians, America\u2019s Health Insurance Plans, and the AHRQ. The mission of this organization is to \u201cImprove health care quality and patient safety through a collaborative process in which key stakeholders agree on a strategy for measuring performance at the physician level; collecting and aggregating data in the least burdensome way; and reporting meaningful information to consumers, physicians and other stakeholders to inform choices and improve outcomes.\u201d A broad range of health care organizations, consumer groups, specialty societies, health care purchasers, and stakeholders joined AQA ().Initially, surgery was not well represented in AQA; however, realizing the importance of the issue at hand, the ACS and other surgical organizations, including the SVS, joined the effort.In its first and invitational meeting held in Washington, DC, on September 8, 2005, over 125 individuals representing about 50 organizations attended the AQA meeting, which was facilitated by Dr Carolyn Clancy, the director of AHRQ. The opening remarks were delivered by Dr Mark McClellan, CMS administrator. This high level representation from CMS and AHRQ, both government agencies under the Department of Health and Human Services, points to the importance this department places on the work of AQA. Staying true to its mission, the work of the AQA was assigned to three major workgroups; performance measurement, data sharing and aggregation, and reporting workgroups. As an indication of the wide representation of the AQA, the reporting workgroup was cochaired by Randy Johnson, the Director of Human Resources Strategic Initiatives of Motorola Corporation, and Dr Nancy Nielson, the Speaker of the House of Delegates of the AMA. This collaboration between a representative from Motorola, a health care purchaser, and the AMA, a health care provider organization, was the idea behind the formation of the AQA.Concerned that surgery would be marginalized in the deliberations of the AQA, ACS went a step further and formed the Surgical Quality Alliance, hoping to involve all surgical specialties and anesthesia to deal with issues of surgical quality and develop surgery-specific measures. In its first meeting in Washington, DC, on December 5, 2005, the group discussed surgical quality measures to finalize their definitions and G-code assignments (). The Surgical Quality Alliance became a very active group; its organizational mission and goals statement highlight its role in bringing surgical specialties together in developing and collating surgical quality measures, disseminating the information on quality initiatives and programs at the federal and private levels, and coordinating the response of the surgical community to such initiatives.To simplify the current process of developing a performance measure: CMS requests a measure directly or through a third party, and the Consortium writes the measure, which is then vetted and endorsed by the National Quality Forum. The AQA gets consensus buy-in from stakeholders, and then CMS uses the measure for P4P purposes ().Fistula First breakthrough initiativeIn addition to working on quality measures, CMS are also delving into the development of comprehensive P4P programs. Actually, the model for such programs is one of interest to vascular surgeons: increasing the percentage of autogenous AV access procedures performed nationally. Autogenous accesses have better patency and fewer complications; therefore, the higher the rate of autogenous accesses placed, the better renal failure patients will fare and the less the expense will be. Obviously, CMS are interested in both outcomes. With CMS\u2019s encouragement, a wide range of organizations provided representatives to the Fistula First coalition. This performance program outgrew from the Fistula First Initiative, which was launched by CMS in early 2004 in response to the high percentage of prosthetic AV accesses placed nationally and to the variation of this rate in different regions of the United States. The Northwest and New England regions enjoy the highest rates of autogenous accesses, whereas the mid-Atlantic area has been plagued with high rates of prosthetic grafts. With CMS\u2019s encouragement, a wide range of organizations () provided representatives to the Fistula First coalition, including representatives from nephrology and surgery, dialysis nurses, dialysis units, hospitals, and corporations, to name a few. The main function of this group was to put together, for CMS consideration, a comprehensive program using financial performance incentives to increase the rate of autogenous access nationally. The stated goals of the effort were to improve the quality of hemodialysis access care by promoting a \u201csafe, effective, patient-centered, timely, efficient, and equitable care provided to individuals with end-stage renal disease.\u201d From the very beginning, representatives of vascular surgery played an active role in this group\u2019s deliberations; our group submitted a proposal suggesting that the financial incentives should be limited in a P4P model to the surgeon performing the procedure and to the dialysis unit that maintains the access, the incentives should be large enough to make a difference, and the data should be adjusted for patient-related factors once the entire program is rolled out. A document was submitted by the Fistula First Coalition to CMS that included some, but not all, of the points suggested by the vascular surgery group.One important and positive byproduct of the Fistula First program was the introduction of a G-code by CMS to improve the use of autogenous venous tissue for access placement. This code, G0365, is eligible for reimbursement and is intended for duplex ultrasound mapping of the extremity\u2019s venous outflow and arterial inflow.Carotid stenting reimbursementIn its memorandum on carotid stenting, CMS introduced perhaps the first P4P program for a surgical specialty. CMS not only required specific conditions for facility certification, but they also set the exact preoperative conditions and the anatomic degree of disease that have to be met to satisfy their conditions for reimbursement.To maintain credentialing, CMS mandated that either the facility or a contractor to the facility collect, analyze, and submit to CMS, on a 6-monthly basis, data on all carotid artery stenting procedures performed at the facility. The data must be made available upon CMS request; a facility continues be reimbursed for this procedure if it maintains a level of performance acceptable to CMS\u2014in other words, P4P.Measuring outcomesPerhaps the most important steps in any P4P program are data collection, aggregation, adjustment, analysis, and reporting. Interestingly enough, however, these are the components that have not been well developed yet. Data collection is primitive, relying on voluntary programs and G-codes. Data aggregation is very limited in its scope. Except for very few examples, data registries that can be used on the national level are almost nonexistent. Available registries are not uniform, and each collects different data points. Programs that use risk adjustment are not available except for the VA and, now, the ACS National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (NSQIP) and the Society for Thoracic Surgery\u2019s Cardiac Surgery Program.National Surgical Quality Improvement ProgramThere is no question that, for many years, the VA has been on the forefront in establishing the premier national quality-improvement program in the nation. This program was initiated in response to a 1986 congressional law that mandated the VA to report its surgical results annually comparing risk-adjusted outcomes with the national average. Interestingly, Congress overlooked the fact at the time that there were no risk-adjusted national outcomes to compare to. This has not changed, and NSQIP remains the first and only noncardiac, national, risk-adjusted, validated, peer-controlled, and outcome-based system; it has been in existence for over 15 years.NSQIP has proven to enhance positively the quality of care of surgical patients in the VA system. From the inception of this program in 1991 to 2002, the 30-day incidence of mortality decreased by 27% and morbidity by 45% in participating VA medical centers.Data on every surgical procedure in VA Medical Centers performed under general, epidural, or spinal anesthesia are collected; in addition, data on specific operations are included regardless of the type of anesthesia used, such as carotid endarterectomy (CEA) performed under local or regional anesthesia. Fifty-two preoperative variables (10 demographic, 30 clinical, and 12 laboratory variables), 15 clinical intraoperative variables, and thirty-three 30-day outcome variables (to include 30-day mortality and hospital length of stay) are collected by a nurse clinical reviewer from electronic medical records on about 115,000 of the total procedures performed in 128 VA hospitals annually. The data are adjusted on the basis of the preoperative risk factors transmitted to the Data Coordinating Center. The rationale for data adjustment and analysis is based on a conceptual framework in which outcomes of health care are determined by three factors: namely, quality of care, patient risk factors, and random variation. If patient\u2019s risk factors are accounted for by risk adjustment and random variation is accounted for by statistical analysis, then outcome accounts for quality of care. The risk-adjusted mortality and morbidity for the particular group of patients are reported as expected. The ratios of observed over expected mortality and morbidity (O/E ratio) are reported to chiefs of surgery on a quarterly basis through a brief report. Annually, a voluminous report is sent to the Chief of Surgery and the leadership of each medical center; it includes data collection, analysis, and, most importantly, comparison with other VA medical centers around the country. The practices of low-outlier medical centers with O/E ratio significantly below 1.0 are considered best practices and are fed back to other medical centers for their consideration and implementation. The validation study has shown that high outliers have inferior structures and processes of care when compared with low outliers.The NSQIP Executive Committee reviews on an annual basis the preceding 4 years\u2019 cumulative results; those medical centers that are consistently high outliers are asked to review specific areas of concern or are visited by a team that would analyze their programs and offer suggestions for change.NSQIP\u2019s leadership is considering future directions for the program, which may include collecting data on long-term survival, functional outcomes, quality of life, patients\u2019 satisfaction, and cost-effectiveness, to name a few. In addition, it is considering the development of process measures that directly affect outcome.Recognizing the importance and the impact of NSQIP on veterans\u2019 health care, private institutions expressed interest in extending this database to nonfederal hospitals. This prompted a pilot study in 1999 to alpha test the program in three non-VA hospitals (University of Michigan, Emory University, and University of Nebraska). When the applicability of this program was proven in this pilot study, the ACS, through a grant from AHRQ, extended this program to 11 additional hospitals in a beta test study. This program, ACS-NSQIP, has been implemented in over 100 hospitals nationwide. In addition, procedure-specific modules based on the NSQIP database, such as bariatric surgery, are being developed by the College in collaboration with specialty societies. Already, NSQIP is serving as a P4P platform for private sector initiatives. Blue Cross/Blue Shield of Michigan started in November of 2005 paying 15 hospitals to participate in ACS-NSQIP and contributing data on general and vascular procedures. This project was an extension of another one that started in 1997 in which Blue Cross/Blue Shield of Michigan paid part of the cost to Michigan hospitals for providing data on percutaneous coronary interventions. During this pay for participation program, no site- or provider-specific data were revealed to Blue Cross/Blue Shield of Michigan or the general public; the data were used by institutions to create quality-improvement measures. This project resulted in a significant drop in complications and a 27% drop in mortality from coronary interventions.ACS-NSQIP seems to be the most logical platform to be used for CMS\u2019 SCIP program. Actually, CMS and its director, Dr McLellan, are very interested in NSQIP migration to the private sector. It is estimated that NSQIP will become the platform for CMS P4P initiatives.SVS carotid stenting and endarterectomy registryIn direct response to CMS\u2019 reimbursement policy for carotid stenting, which required hospitals to maintain ongoing data and information about these procedures, the Outcomes Committee of the SVS headed by immediate past President Greg Sicard and supported by current President Enrico Ascher and the leadership of the SVS, urgently put together the SVS carotid stenting and CEA registry. This database is designed to comply with CMS payment requirements and collect long-term data on carotid stenting and CEA. Currently, this is the only registry that incorporates CEA data in addition to stenting. The registry is Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act compliant and Web based and provides the ability of designated individuals in each of the participating medical centers to obtain real-time reports of their center\u2019s results with comparison to national averages and other centers in a blinded fashion. Institutions that participate in this database are ready to provide CMS with the data required for their recredentialing.FundingPerhaps there is no other issue that engenders more heated and passionate discussion than the issue of funding. Appropriate and widespread implementation of P4P will require a considerable infrastructure, the expense of which will be borne by hospitals for inpatients and by physicians for patients in their practice. Although P4P has implicit incentives due to improved efficiency, decreased morbidity, and improved outcomes, direct incentive payment for P4P is what counts to providers. The sources for such direct incentives can be additional funding over and above established reimbursement; this is the method preferred by providers and the one that makes most sense. Less favorable methods include withholding a certain percentage of reimbursement to be earned back when certain performance measures are met or a method that has been recently discussed, which is to increase funding for the top performers and reduce it for the bottom performers compared with norms.In the minds of many, the last two options amount to yet another decrease in reimbursement that would be over and above the expected drop in the value of the conversion factor of 4% to 5% a year over the next five or more years.Although all discussions indicate to the use of additional funding for P4P, such funding has yet to be allocated by Congress. A bill sponsored by Representative Nancy Johnson that proposed funding for P4P programs in the 2006 budget was encouraging; however, hopes were dashed when the budget reconciliation bill that finally passed included a widely reported $36 billion in Medicare cuts over the next 5 years with no funding for P4P. I would like to point out that the lack of appropriated funds is definitely not slowing down this process; it is going on as strong as ever. Actually, CMS rolled out the PVRP program with no additional funding or financial incentives provided. Also, on February 21, 2006, an article in theNew York Timesshed light on a \u201cjoint House-Senate working agreement with the AMA\u201d signed on December 16, 2005, by Dr Duane Cady, Chairman of the AMA Board, and by Chairmen Grassley, Thomas, and Deal on behalf of Congress. In this \u201cconfidential\u201d agreement, AMA committed to developing about 140 physician performance measures in 34 clinical areas by the end of 2006. The agreement also included a commitment that doctors will voluntarily report to the federal government data on these quality measures by 2007. In a letter to the AMA, the presidents of seven medical specialty groups objected that AMA signed this agreement without consultation with their groups, partly basing their objection on the fact that the AMA did not get assurances that physicians will be adequately compensated for participating in this P4P initiative. In response to theTimesarticle, Michael Maves, the Executive Vice President of the AMA, sent a memo to national medical specialty societies and state medical associations clarifying the agreement. In his memo, Maves stated that the Congressional leaders were committed to address payment and quality reforms in 2006. Dr Maves also maintained that the AMA was under intense pressure to agree to the points stated in the memo, indicating that Congress would be \u201cless inclined to address payment cuts triggered by the Sustainable Growth Rate (SGR) formula if there was insufficient progress on the quality front.\u201dConcerns, conclusions, and recommendationsAs P4P systems are being devised, we need to recognize issues of concern that need to be addressed. These include the lack of testing and validation of performance measures and the paucity of level 1 or even level 2 evidence on which to base performance measures for the majority of surgical and vascular procedures. In addition, attention should be paid to developing process measurements that assess the complete surgical experience and continuum of care and not only short-term outcomes. This would include indications, preoperative evaluation, operative parameters, and long-term outcomes. Recent discussions have revolved around \u201cefficiency measures\u201d; although, during discussions about the \u201cefficiency of care\u201d the cost of care is always linked to quality to produce efficiency measures, it is of concern that the cost of providing care becomes a goal in and of itself. Furthermore, CMS and various private healthcare purchasers and insurance companies are pushing hard for expediency in the development of P4P measures and initiatives; it is concerning that the process is moving ahead of the infrastructure needed to support it. In addition, many other questions remain: How should we set performance targets? How many data should be required, and who should collect them? How about risk adjustment, and should we accept non\u2013risk-adjusted data as a basis for P4P? Should providers be rewarded if they meet a target or if they improve from their baseline? Should incentives be directed to physicians, hospitals, or a combination of those?As this process is rapidly moving forward, Vascular Surgery can take the position that the actual implementation of a comprehensive program is few years away, pay no attention to it now, and play catch up later or, preferably, be involved in the process. As we examine our options, please consider the following: It is incumbent upon us, as surgeons and vascular surgeons, to be fully engaged in all aspects of this process, populating various national and local committees, subcommittees, and workgroups to maximize our impact. To do so, we need volunteers who are willing to dedicate their time and effort to this process. We need especially the involvement of those in private practice. These colleagues are going to deal with these issues in their offices and practices; their challenges can be very different from those in full-time practice. Their input will be highly valuable.Our influence will help make P4P medically and surgically pertinent and, thus, more acceptable. We should encourage our institutions to participate in ACS-NSQIP. The process is ongoing, and the sooner we get involved in it, the better. Vascular surgeons have always submitted themselves to self-critique. We have never shied away from discussing our complications; we should not be apprehensive or worried now about numerically representing our overall performance.Finally, P4P is here to stay. The tide is too strong to reverse. No type of practice will be immune since both the public and private sectors are highly interested in seeing P4P programs expand and mature; they see it as an opportunity to improve quality and curtail cost. Most importantly, P4P has the full support of consumer groups, the most prominent of which is the American Association of Retired Persons (AARP). This common interest in this one issue by Congress, insurance companies, health care purchasers, and the AARP is very powerful. The last time these groups got together, the unimaginable happened; Congress enacted the Medicare Drug Prescription Bill!",
  "2012": "As the Society for Vascular Surgery (SVS) approaches its 70th anniversary, I am awed and humbled at the great privilege, if somewhat improbable circumstance, of leading the nation's oldest and largest society devoted to the care of patients with vascular disease. My term has been both rewarding and certainly the assemblage of a presidential address has at times daunted me. I have been steered by the wisdom of Presidents past; I learned much from Dr Shumaker's fascinating history of the first 50 years of the SVS,and I am pleased to report that in follow-up of our 50th anniversary meeting, Drs Jimmy Yao and Norm Rich are leading an effort to chronicle our past 20 years.In deciding on fact or philosophy for this address, I have fundamentally come to the position that I am first and foremost a vascular surgeon and accordingly, my topic this morning, on carotid atherosclerosis, is one of the core components of vascular surgical practice coming into the modern era shortly after the founding of the SVS in 1947. Furthermore, there has been much activity in the carotid arena of late; some of this is actually science, much is not. Also, in such Presidential addresses, tradition must be served, and the great tradition of our society is entwined with certain Boston Pioneers and with the evolution of vascular surgery at the Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH), where I have had the great privilege to spend essentially my entire professional career. From the vision of its 31 Founding Members, the SVS has evolved in stature, size, and influence as among the nation's pre-eminent medical professional organizations. Our recent history has solidified SVS as the representative organization for all vascular surgeons, and today, we stand nearly 4000 members strong, with an annual budget of some 7 million dollars, and an effective force of nearly 300 of our members carrying out the SVS mission in some 30 different councils and committees. In particular, I owe a great deal to my colleagues on the SVS Executive Committee who provided me with both wisdom and the sometimes needed temperance over the past year.Customary in a Presidential address is the acknowledgment of the many in my personal and professional life that made it possible for me to become your 66th president. My professional evolution at the MGH in Boston began only after disillusionment at the prospect of becoming a cardiac surgeon. I went to medical school convinced I would be a cardiac surgeon. I was only dissuaded during my subinternship on cardiac surgery. Accordingly, when I had the great fortune to do a subinternship in vascular surgery at the MGH under the tutelage of my professional godfather, Dr R. Clement Darling, Jr, MD, in September of 1976, I discovered the specialty that seem to suit me so well as the vascular surgeon was the expert in the diagnosis, clinical decision-making, and execution of the surgical treatment of patients afflicted with vascular disease. Perhaps even more impressive, at the time, no other medical or surgical specialty either knew anything about vascular disease nor had any interest in being involved in same. To be sure, a Shangri-La of sorts, but of course, not reality today.The history of vascular surgery at MGH and the founding of the SVSThe history of vascular surgery at the MGH is intimately entwined with the beginning days of the SVS. Arthur Allen, MD (), was the first vascular surgeon at the MGH. He was, by all accounts, a surgeon for all seasons with the wide range of interests in surgery that crossed gastrointestinal, endrocrine, and vascular surgery. Influenced to a degree by John Homans, also in Boston, he was writing on periarterial sympathectomy in the 1920s in the originalBoston Medical and Surgery Journal, which would ultimately become theNew England Journal of Medicine. Allen was appointed Chief of the Vascular Clinic at the MGH in 1928, the first such clinic of its kind in the US. It is extraordinary to read some of his early work, such as his report on the use of typhoid vaccine injection to augment the microcirculation in young people with gangrene, likely secondary to what we would refer to today as thromboanginitis obliterans.This paper was read before the annual meeting of the American Medical Association in 1928; it contributed to Allen's national stature as a leader in vascular disease management. Allen spent a large part of his professional career investigating the prophylaxis of pulmonary embolism and was the first to promulgate ligation of the superficial femoral vein in the prevention of pulmonary embolism. His paper, on the MGH series of such operations, delivered before the American Surgical Association in 1943,positioned him as one of the national leaders in an effort to initiate a surgical professional society devoted to vascular disease management. Accordingly, he was one of a group of six individuals who held an initial organizational meeting in December of 1945 at the Southern Surgical Association; a follow-up meeting occurred the following July, and the SVS was launched. The initial SVS scientific meeting was held on the Steel Pier in Atlantic City, New Jersey, in June of 1947. Allen, who would go on to be the second president of the SVS, succeeding Alton Ochsner, chaired the program committee of that first meeting; the very first paper at the very first SVS meeting was delivered by one Robert R. Linton, MD, whose name is forever associated with the origins of modern vascular surgery, both in Boston and across the nation. Linton, in turn, had catapulted to national fame based on his work with lower extremity venous disease and his sentinel work published in 1938, which was the initial description of the importance of the ligation of incompetent perforating veins in the prevention of the postthrombotic syndrome.Accordingly, Linton was well positioned to initiate modern arterial reconstructive surgery at the MGH right around the year I was born; his contributions to vascular surgery were many, and his ninth SVS presidential address delivered in 1955 was, in fact, the first of the SVS Presidential addresses to deal with direct arterial reconstructive surgery. In the twilight of his career, Dr Linton was invited to give the prestigious Homan's lecture before the SVS, and his topic was John Homans' impact on Venous Surgery. Interestingly, most of this address centered on the effectiveness of the methods Linton developed (ligation of incompetent perforators), as opposed to radical soft tissue excision and skin grafting espoused by Homans!Linton was a master technical surgeon and performed the first successful direct repairs of both abdominal aortic aneurysms and autogenous veins bypass surgery in New England. His monumentalAtlas of Vascular Surgery, published in the early 1970s, was for many years a vascular surgery bible and a prized possession of graduating MGH Vascular Surgical Trainees. When I received mine, I was the initial Robert R. Linton Research Fellow. The circle is now complete with the inauguration of the Robert R. Linton, MD, professorship in Vascular and Endovascular Surgery at the Harvard Medical School and the Massachusetts General Hospital. To be the first incumbent of this chair is for me the stuff that dreams are made of. Linton's prot\u00e9g\u00e9 and partner, joining him in practice at the MGH in 1960 after a two-year fellowship with Dr DeBakey, was Dr R. Clement Darling, Jr, who was my principle teacher of vascular surgery. He opened his practice to me in the evolution of our central aortic practice. A few years ago, as president of the New England Society for Vascular Surgery, I had the opportunity to recount in detail Dr Darling's many contributions to vascular surgery.Dr Darling was reporting large series of femoropopliteal vein bypass grafts before the SVS in the mid-1960s; he invented and promulgated the lower extremity arterial noninvasive technique that is widely used across the world today in a sentinel report delivered before the SVS in 1971.To Dr Darling, I owe an incredible debt, and yes, he was the father of our current SVS treasurer Dr R. Clement Darling, III, from Albany, New York. Although by proxy, Dr E. Stanley Crawford was both my hero and had a profound influence on the development of my aortic surgery practice. Dr Crawford was chief resident at the MGH in 1955, and perhaps the greatest aortic surgeon who ever lived. His autographed picture, which hangs in my office, is signed \u201cbest wishes and highest esteem.\u201d By proxy, I mean that Dr Crawford's son, John, who joined him in the authorship of the monumental Crawford'sAtlas of Aortic Surgery, was chief resident with me at the MGH in 1984. Dr Crawford, our 42nd president, delivered the Homans lecture in 1991 through his son, John, because at that point, Dr Crawford was disabled with a stroke; his address, entitled \u201cHeroes in Vascular Surgery,\u201d was one of the more inspiring things I have ever heard at a scientific meeting.My colleagues in the division of vascular and endovascular surgery at the MGH are my special family. They are the reason I find it so much fun to go to work every day. Our many vascular fellows over the years have contributed to my professional development in a way that they could never know. They have had to endure my intensity and my insistence on perfection passed down from Dr Linton, but they annually renew me with their accomplishments and their own individual outstanding stories.Personal historyYou have heard elements of my personal story from President-Elect Gloviczki. Dr Sanjiv Chopra, who has lectured all over the world on leadership, indicates that all leaders have a story to tell.I hope you will indulge me a few moments to hear mine. As a small child, I came under the influence of John Caccamo, my maternal grandfather. He was an outstanding, if typical, representative of the great wave of immigrants who sought a better life in America. Coming to this country from Sicily as a desperately poor 16-year-old in 1904 with little more than an address of certain relatives who settled in Brooklyn, he had to wait 3 weeks in confinement at Ellis Island to be sure that he did not bring tuberculosis into the country. He was a man of great faith, if somewhat stern, but embodied that outstanding quality of the immigrant generation \u2013 a fierce tenacity to succeed. He started the family business \u2013 John's Meat Market \u2013 the butcher shop establishment, which operated for some 70 consecutive years in Elizabeth, New Jersey, where I spent my formative years and where later, my father would teach me many things, including how to carve a side of beef! My father was a perfect example of what Tom Brokaw and Stephen Ambrose termed \u201cthe greatest generation this country has ever produced.\u201d Like so many of his generation, many of his prime years were spent in the military service of his country. As a navigator/bombardier on a B-25 in the horror of the Pacific theater in World War II, he was witness to history on August 9, 1945, when he saw the second atom bomb explode over Nagasaki, effectively ending World War II. His influence on me was enormous, but of course it was some years before I recognized this; he taught me humanism and kindness, which I hope to have brought to the care of the thousands of patients I have had the privilege to care for over the past 30 years. In each person's development, there are profound influences, usually early in life, and mine was working side-by-side with my father in the butcher shop beginning when I was 12 years of age. In his bookOutliers, Malcolm Gladwell examines the careers of some outstandingly successful people and, in a very learned treatise, ascribes success more to circumstance than to brilliance.The people who stand before kings may look like they did it all by themselves \u2026 but, in fact, they are the beneficiaries of hidden advantages and extraordinary opportunities and cultural legacies that allow them to work hard and make sense of the world in ways others cannot. It makes a difference where and when we grew up. The culture we belong to and the legacies passed down by our forebears shape the patterns of our achievement in ways we cannot begin to imagine.Accordingly, I am here before you today as SVS president because my father took me as a young boy to work with him in the butcher shop. It's as simple as all that. My wife, Chris, and my five children have sustained me these past 30 years and continue to do so. They never asked, \u201cDo you have to make rounds today?\u201d My first son, Andy, was born when I was an intern, and now having come full circle, my wife, Chris and I experienced the unbelievable joy of our first grandchild, baby Sadie, born 18 months ago at the MGH and timed perfectly in between cases! I have had many blessings in life, but being baby Sadie's pop-pop is just about the best of them. While supporting me, my wife and children have also kept me grounded. Let me give you an example; my second son, Jay, when he was 16, had a good way of putting it. I had gone to look at a job in Cleveland at some point in midcareer and was chatting about it with the family. My son Jay's comment was, \u201cDad, we want you to know that if you take that job in Cleveland, you can call home anytime you want.\u201d Needless to say, I stayed in Boston.SVS initiativesWhile I intended to stick to topic, I would be remiss if I failed to report on some of our major developments in the SVS this year, and many of these are in the carotid sphere, thus the rationale for focusing on the carotid disease debate today. Now about a year and a half old, the Vascular Quality Initiative (VQI) has positioned our society and our profession as the leaders in quality improvement efforts relative to vascular procedures. SVS leadership over the past several years felt it entirely appropriate and vitally important for SVS to be in a leadership position in such activities. Modeled on the highly successful and now 9-year-old vascular study group of New England, the VQI has several distinct components, as recently reviewed by our medical director, Jack Cronenwett, in theJournal of Vascular Surgery.These include an Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality-certified Patient Safety Organization, which incidentally, was the very first medical profession society to hold such designation, regional quality groups, and a robust procedural data platform with our corporate partner who provides the web-based data platform. This effort has grown exponentially in the past 16 months, and we currently have approximately 200 hospitals and over 50,000 procedures in the database. I encourage all SVS members to join in the VQI effort; it is an important vehicle to advance our specialty and benchmark your practice.A particular effort during my presidency has been to facilitate one of our strategic goals articulated in 2008, namely an increase in the number of newly trained vascular surgeons. Both projections of the total numbers of practicing vascular surgeons, the age demographics of our workforce, and the actual data in our fellowship training programs reveal the relatively flat trajectory in the vascular surgery workforce. While many surgical subspecialties have seen a decrement in the pool of qualified applicants for training programs, the now 5-year-old 0-5 integrated vascular residency training paradigm has been fabulously successful and is among the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education's most avidly sought subspecialty training programs. Bringing quality vascular care to all types of practice settings can only be accomplished by increasing the supply of vascular surgeons. We initiated a vascular fellowship development task force over the past year. I am greatly indebted to the vascular surgery leaders who joined me in this task force: Ronald Dalman, John Eidt, Vivian Gahtan, Jeffrey Jim, Craig Kent, Michel Makaroun, and Jon Matsumura. Our committee was composed of representatives from different geographic regions across the country, and we assembled a list of potential practices and hospitals wherein vascular residencies and/or fellowships could be developed. I am pleased to announce that as a product of this task force, SVS has now made available to prospective fellowship sites a series of programs, tools, and mechanisms to foster the development of new vascular residencies and/or fellowships.

Listed in theare some of the important events more recently, which makes a consideration of the carotid paradigm an appropriate topic for today's meeting. After the publication of a number of European-based randomized trials clearly implicating CEA as the preferred treatment (vs CAS) in the management of, in particular, symptomatic patients, the medical community eagerly awaited completion of the Carotid Revascularization Endarterectomy versus Stenting Trial (CREST).Both practitioners and regulatory agencies would consider this large well-conducted trial as a sentinel event in the carotid sphere. Soon after publication of the CREST study in mid-2010, these data were incorporated into the promulgation of some five different international practice guidelines published in 2011, which were recently compared in a shortJournal of Vascular Surgeryreview article upon which I had the privilege to comment.Doubtless you are familiar with the SVS updated practice guidelines that contain the best available/most declarative/evidence-based management guidelines for patients with carotid stenosis.Also, in 2011, the SVS Clinical Research Council convened a clinical research priorities retreat with 40 experts gathering to hear presentations and otherwise vote in hierarchical fashion on the important clinical research questions in our practice. As a product of that meeting, SVS identified clinical management of asymptomatic carotid stenosis as its number one clinical research priority. This is not to be interpreted as a retribution of any component of the updated 2011 SVS practice guidelines referable to carotid disease, but rather an acknowledgment that further research in characterizing the nature and risk of asymptomatic carotid stenosis is certainly in order. Details of the research priorities retreat will soon be published in JVS.In anticipation of a reconsideration by Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) of the National Coverage Determination (NCD) for CAS, the SVS board of directors by vote of 21 of its 22 members in June 2011 (repeated in identical manner and result at the June 2012 Board of Directors meeting), voted against any change in SVS position relative to the current CMS coverage determination for CAS. In additional, and at the invitation of CMS, SVS submitted (in May 2012) a detailed position statement opposing any change in the current NCD relative to CAS. Although an application was made to CMS, it was deferred when CMS instead convened a medical evidence discovery and coverage analysis group meeting (MEDCAC) in January of this year. A MEDCAC meeting is different than a reconsideration of coverage and consists of a panel of medical experts who hear both invited testimony and then at-large testimony from interested stake holders. Given the importance of carotid disease as a core component of vascular surgery practice, SVS had a very active role at the January MEDCAC, offering a variety of oral presentations and submitting a comprehensive document addressing the meeting's seven research questions, and this material was recently published in theJournal of Vascular Surgery.Carotid disease and stroke: The fundamentalsThe supporting research data in the carotid sphere could occupy a textbook; indeed, the Rutherford textbook of vascular surgery contains some 11 chapters and 200 pages devoted to the management of cerebrovascular disease. Yet, not since SVS 31st President Jesse Thompson Homans' lecture, delivered in 1995 at the 50th anniversary meeting, has there been comprehensive treatment of the carotid story from this podium. Dr Thompson's wonderful treatise, which should be read by all students of carotid surgery, closed with an admonition referable to CAS \u2026 and I quote, \u201cmortality and stroke rates are not acceptable when compared to carotid endarterectomy.\u201dHe went on to quote Osler, \u201c\u2026the foolishness of yesterday has become the wisdom of tomorrow.\u201d As I will review with you, 15 years hence, the clinical realities as reviewed in SVS practice guidelines have not changed much.I have chosen to outline this topic beginning with fundamentals of pathogenesis, and proceeding to natural history data before considerations of the efficacy and safety of intervention. What I refer to as the fundamentals of pathology and pathophysiology, while well known to most vascular surgeons, is important to delineate as a foundation for clinical decision making in carotid disease. It is my belief that such considerations are not in the knowledge base of some who seek to manage carotid disease. Any prophylactic treatment, whether it be repair of an abdominal aortic aneurysm or carotid endarterectomy for asymptomatic carotid stenosis is, of course, predicated on a thorough knowledge of the natural history of the lesion without treatment, and an important consideration in the carotid sphere is the role and/or limitations of modern medical therapy in the management of those with asymptomatic carotid stenosis. Where we have come with both CEA and where we hope to potentially go with CAS are important elements of the debate, as is, of course, the available comparative data referable to CEA and CAS.The father of carotid surgery was, in fact, not a surgeon at all. Rather, the original description of the relationship between carotid disease and its causative role in ipsilateral hemispheric stroke was delineated by C. Miller Fisher, MD, a stroke neurologist who spent his career at the MGH. In 1949, the preponderance of thought was that ischemic stroke was largely related to vasospasm and/or spontaneous thrombosis of the middle cerebral artery. In dissecting brains of patients who had died of stroke, Miller Fisher made the observation that there was no trace of vascular blockage in the middle cerebral artery. He took this apparent incongruity during further investigations as a stroke fellow at the Montreal Neurological Institute. He recorded carefully elements of histories of patients who had severe hemispheric stroke, noting that a history of transient monocular blindness on the side contralateral to the stroke was frequently obtained. One such patient, whom he had questioned carefully, died of a rectal carcinoma, and Miller Fisher pushed to perform an autopsy, including the ipsilateral carotid artery. One of my favorite papers in the realm of carotid surgery was published by Miller Fisher in 1951 (the year I was born) in the Archives of Neurology and Psychiatry. The paper itself is an exhaustive review of eight cases of carotid related major stroke, complete with angiography and autopsy findings.In this paper, Miller Fisher speculated that, \u201cone day surgeons may even devise a method to remove the offending plaque and thereby prevent stroke.\u201d His prophecy, of course, was soon realized when surgeons on three different continents attempted to do just that. Most notable was the operation reported by Eastcott, Pickering, and Rob, although theirs was an excision and graft restruction procedure.The operation, as we perform it today, was originally described by Dr DeBakey, although his series was not published until some years later.Although the relationship of carotid bifurcation atherosclerosis as an important cause of stroke was thus established, only later was the nature of the pathology fully appreciated. Vascular surgeons who have opened many carotid bifurcation specimens have appreciated for some time that dynamic plaque events are both the essence of the pathophysiology of stroke related to carotid stenosis, and, in fact, the distinction that makes treatment of carotid atherosclerosisfundamentally differentfrom treatment of coronary or renal or mesenteric or superficial femoral artery occlusive disease wherein relief of ischemia from vascular obstruction is the anatomic goal of therapy. C. Miller Fisher also described the important contingency of the rich collateral circulation that exists to the brain. Thus, the removal of a carotid bifurcation plaque was never about a \u201crevascularization\u201d or bringing circulation to an ischemic territory such as we would do in other vascular territories. Rather, the rationale of this operation has always been theremoval of a dynamic disease process wherein dynamic plaque events either have already, or have the potential to cause thromboembolic stroke.Where then in this paradigm was there ever any rationale for the luminal expansion of a necrotic plaque with an uncovered stent? Indeed, vascular surgeons made the initial descriptions that certain plaque features \u2013 such as ulceration \u2013 were correlated with increased risk of stroke. In a series of publications beginning in 1969 (the year I graduated high school), SVS 41st president and 2011 SVS Lifetime Achievement Award winner Dr Wesley Moore described the ominous implications and stroke potential of plaque ulceration.Dr Moore, as national co-principal investigator of the CREST trial, was invited to testify at the CMS January 2012 MEDCAC on carotid atherosclerosis. I can assure you that his testimony was not only wise and informed, but also 100% consistent with SVS practice guidelines. There is now appreciation that events such as intraplaque hemorrhage described by Drs Imparato and Wylie are elemental in the pathogenesis of stroke.Knowledge of such pathology has opened the next arena of plaque characterization as an important component of risk stratification in asymptomatic patients utilizing a number of different imaging techniques to provide such plaque characterization. These include high-resolution ultrasound as verified in the Asymptomatic Carotid Stenosis and Risk of Stroke study reported at our meeting in 2010.In this study, a number of clinical and plaque features, as determined by duplex ultrasound, figured prominently in stroke prediction from previously asymptomatic lesions although degree of stenosis was also a strong correlate of neurologic event risk in this study. High resolution magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has also been used for this purpose. Investigators of the cooperative High Resolution Magnetic Resonance Imaging in Atherosclerosis of the Carotid Artery (HIRISC) study group studied 234 patients, half of whom were symptomatic, and noted the frequent occurrence of intraplaque hemorrhage overall and its strong association with increasing degree of stenosis.While stroke risk correlated with MRI demonstrated intraplaque hemorrhage in symptomatic patients, this correlation is hardly perfect. Finally, carotid plaque derivative phenomenon such as transcranial Doppler-detected silent microembolic phenomenon has also been championed to risk-stratify asymptomatic patients. A meta-analysis of same published in JVS last year re-emphasized the correlation of both transcranial Doppler-detected micro emboli and prior CT scan demonstrated infarction with stroke and with increasing degrees of stenosis.In consideration of a treatment paradigm, it is important to understand that all pathology occurs in a spectrum and that the correlation of plaque pathology with symptoms of transient ischemic attack (TIA) and stroke is hardly perfect. A 2012 meta-analysis collected information on a large number of explanted carotid specimens, and, while establishing that ulceration was the strongest correlate of a symptomatic lesion, the correlation was again hardly perfect. This may have been related to time interval between symptom onset and carotid endarterectomy.Different, but related, observations were made in the large Oxford study of carotid plaques published in 2006, which concluded that unstable plaque features were both more common in symptomatic versus asymptomatic plaques and that there were similar pathologic correlates to unstable coronary plaques; dense inflammation in the plaque correlated strongly with fibrous cap rupture and time since stroke.Accordingly, it is intuitively logical that vascular surgeons who had been in the habit of examining these specimens for years were horrified at the prospect of luminal expansion of an uncovered stent in the midst of such pathology. Indeed, our inherent objection to the rationale of this therapy has in fact been proven correct if one reviews the available data, which I will shortly, on CAS even with distal protection strategies. A recent study from the Emory group is consistent with prior data using MRI-detected periprocedural brain micro emboli. Using TCD, these investigators noted micro emboli significantly more common with CAS versus CEA irrespective of the CAS protection strategy.What then of the natural history of a carotid bifurcation lesion? It has now been abundantly demonstrated in the large symptomatic patient trials, that even in an era of considerable operative morbidity (\u22487.5% risk stroke/death), there was a highly significant benefit for CEA versus medical therapy in all of these trials.This, in turn, was related to the prohibitive risk of stroke in patients with symptomatic high-grade stenosis who were managed with medical therapy alone. Accordingly, CEA for symptomatic lesions is an indicated intervention for short-term stroke prevention, and the risk/benefit ratio is slanted in favor of CEA in virtually all patients. In contrast to this is the paradox that CAS at the carotid bifurcation has its highest, and some would say unacceptable, complication rate in the treatment of symptomatic patients, in particular, in elderly symptomatic patients, especially if such treatment is carried out within 2 weeks of symptom onset, which of course is the time interval when maximum benefit of CEA is achieved. This facet is emphasized in a current report delivered from Dr Fraedrich's group from Innsbruck, Austria, pooling data from several of the European randomized trials (Endarterectomy versus Angioplasty in Patients with Symptomatic Severe Carotid Stenosis [EVA-3S], Stent-Protected Angioplasty versus Carotid Endarterectomy in symptomatic patients [SPACE], and International Carotid Stenting Study [ICSS]). These investigators noted a two-fold increase in stroke/death for CAS versus CEA, with a proportionally higher risk for CAS conducted within 7 days of the qualifying event.Indeed, similar data had already been reported in a number of the industry-sponsored CAS registries; in the Carotid Acculink/Accunet Post-Approval Trial to Uncover Unanticipated or Rare Events (CAPTURE) Registry for either elderly or symptomatic patients, stroke rates after CAS were essentially doubled.A recent report from the SVS Outcomes Committee, using data from the SVS Carotid Registry, examined outcomes for CEA versus CAS in patients stratified by Medicare age. The data are powerful, with some 4000 CEA and 2500 CAS procedures included; accordingly, the large numbers allow for appropriate risk adjustment. The primary composite endpoint of 30-day stroke/death/myocardial infarction was seen in 4.21% of CEA versus 7.11% of CAS procedures in patients \u226565 years \u2013 and the difference was highly significant, and as anticipated, was proportionally larger in symptomatic patients, although also significant in asymptomatic patients.Asymptomatic patients: Revisionist history is usually wrongIt is, of course, expected that the net gain achieved with CEA in asymptomatic patients would be much less impressive than that seen in symptomatic patients. Accordingly, modern natural history studies and clinical trials in asymptomatic patients form the basis of clinical decision-making in such patients as articulated in the SVS practice guidelines.Two important provisos qualify current recommendations and, indeed, the controversy over intervention of any kind in asymptomatic patients. The first of these, as alluded to previously, is the generally accepted tenet that better methods are needed to \u201crisk-stratify\u201d asymptomatic plaques and patients. Currently, of course, we use degree of stenosis in clinical decision-making, which I will shortly hope to convince you that, while an imperfect surrogate, is in fact, reasonably accurate in stroke risk prediction and, of course, is easily and cost-effectively quantifiable. The second issue is the fashionable position (in some quarters) that modern medical therapy has so radically changed the natural history or stroke risk of even high-grade asymptomatic lesions, that intervention of any kind is no longer warranted \u2013 but more on that issue shortly.So what are the natural history data referable asymptomatic carotid stenoses? The modern era of such studies dates to a full 25 years ago, when Chambers and Norris, in a widely quoted study published in theNew England Journal of Medicine, defined stroke risk in asymptomatic patients as substantial in patients with high-grade stenosis and linearly associated with both degree of stenosis and progression under observation.A common theme in many of the early studies was that associated cardiovascular events in general were also common, limiting patients' life expectancy and tempering somewhat enthusiasm for prophylactic treatment of asymptomatic stenoses. The ominous implication of lesion progression was confirmed in a large modern series from Dr Schillinger's group in Vienna. Over a thousand patients with any degree of carotid stenosis were first assessed with two duplex studies just 7 months apart, and then followed for a median of 3 years for clinical events. Almost 10% of patients experienced progression over just 7 months, and in these, stroke risk was increased two-fold despite the fact that 70% of patients with progression were being treated with statins, which did not control the disease.With the large cohort of patients available from the North American Symptomatic Carotid Endarterectomy Trial (NASCET) study, derivative information indicated that the risk of stroke related to asymptomatic stenosis was greatest in patients with the most severe degrees of stenosis, and secondly, that stroke was more likely to be the first event (as opposed to TIA), thereby dynamiting a strategy of wait for the first TIA. In summary, for >60% of NASCET lesions, an annual carotid-related stroke risk of 2% per year for asymptomatic patients was the take-home message.Indeed, this figure is entirely consistent with the observed actuarial 5-year ipsilateral stroke risk in the medical therapy arm of the Asymptomatic Carotid Surgery Trial (ACST) trial.The most recently published large scale prospective study of the natural history of asymptomatic carotid stenosis was the Asymptomatic Carotid Stenosis and Risk of Stroke study published initially in 2005,and then with the aforementioned follow-up report presented at this meeting in 2010.These investigators followed more than 1000 patients with moderate-to-severe degrees of asymptomatic stenosis and, once again, confirmed that neurologic event risk correlated strongly with degree of stenosis and certain clinical features such as smoking and abnormal renal function. Indeed, in patients harboring asymptomatic stenoses wherein treatment would be recommended by current SVS guidelines, there was a substantial risk of TIA and stroke, which occurred in about a 50:50 proportion at just 3 years of follow-up. The data indicate that the combined TIA/stroke risk was substantial at 10% at 3 years for those with a degree of stenosis such that intervention would ordinarily be recommended. The combination of clinical factors and duplex characterization of the plaque could predict high- or low-risk patients, and certainly these ultrasound observations need to be validated in further prospective studies. These natural history studies in aggregate indicate that, while degree of stenosis may be an imperfect surrogate for stroke risk referable to asymptomatic carotid stenosis, it is, at the moment, the best we have, and accordingly has figured prominently in current practice guidelines.The related and currently controversial topic includes the claim that modern medical therapy has made intervention for asymptomatic stenosis obsolete. Most clinicians recognize that there is no prospective trial data to support this claim, but the inferences made from literature reviews have been widely promulgated, and it is certainly true that there are major transatlantic differences of opinion in this regard. Furthermore, the argument is not necessarily aligned along medical specialty disciplines. A transatlantic debate published in theJVSlast year emphasized the major differences in approach to asymptomatic disease even among vascular surgeons.The first thing to be said is that none would argue against the fact that modern medical therapy has had an important overall positive effect in stroke reduction. Several meta-analyses of prospective trials in this regard indicate that statin therapy compared with placebo significantly reduced both stroke risk and carotid intima-media thickness.Furthermore, in patients who have sustained either a TIA or stroke, the use of statin medications has clearly been documented to significantly reduce the risk of subsequent neurologic events as demonstrated, for example, in the Stroke Prevention by Aggressive Reduction in Cholesterol Level (SPARCL) Trial.Yet these data are quite a different matter than claiming that optimal medical therapy has obviated the need for intervention in patients with high-grade asymptomatic carotid stenosis. There is little doubt that this viewpoint owes largely to a meta-analysis published in 2009 by Dr Ann Abbott, an academic neurologist from Australia who is both an ardent critic and prolific investigator in the carotid sphere. It is evident that Dr Abbott's message has resonated across the Atlantic as she was one of the invited testifiers at the January CMS MEDCAC on carotid atherosclerosis, obviously chosen to champion the role of optimal medical therapy.This meta-analysis, which I believe you will find somewhat difficult to read \u2013 I certainly did \u2013 and accordingly, I have had it analyzed by a number of experts with sophistication in research methodology and statistics. After such study, my conclusion and that of many others, is that the meta-analysis is flawed for several reasons. Firstly and most importantly, the studies included in the retrospective meta-analysis have not been corrected for threshold levels of carotid stenosis at patient entry, or, stated differently, the anticipated stroke risk is greatly diminished by the inclusion of many patients with moderate degrees of carotid stenosis wherein the acknowledged risk of stroke is low, and for whom intervention would never be recommended by current SVS practice guidelines or in fact any other practice guidelines.Oddly, the review did not include perhaps the best contemporary data, namely the medically treated patients in the ACST trial, apparently because ACST had a 6-month threshold for symptom-free status. Let us review some of the literature base which drives the meta-analysis conclusions. Consider the widely quoted Second Manifestations of ARTerial disease (SMART) study; less than half of the approximately 200 patients considered in this cohort had stenosis where you and I would recommend a carotid intervention.Similarly, the Oxford Vascular Study, which was published inStrokein 2010, proudly announced that ipsilateral stroke in patients with asymptomatic carotid stenosis occurred in only 0.34% per year with best medical therapy! However, once again, only a small number of patients had a degree of carotid stenosis for which intervention would be recommended; in fact only 32 and 3 of those, or 10%, had a stroke!Although not available at the time of Dr Abbott's 2009 meta-analysis, published soon thereafter were the results of the natural history of asymptomatic carotid stenosis in the large Reduction of Atherothrombosis for Continued Health (REACH) cardiovascular registry.REACH is an international registry of over 30,000 patients with a variety of vascular territory diseases and provides up to 48-month clinical follow-up. This study compared over 3000 patients with an asymptomatic carotid stenosis in the 70% or greater range (ie, those for whom you and I would recommend CEA, as opposed to those without), and compared their natural history both in terms of stroke risk and overall cardiovascular events. The data indicated that the 1-year risk of TIA or stroke in patients with asymptomatic high-grade carotid stenosis was 6.5%, or two-fold that of those with lesser degrees of carotid stenosis; the difference was highly significant for both stroke and other cardiovascular events as well. It is important to emphasize that some 70% of all patients in both cohorts were on statin therapy at the time they were being followed in the registry. Optimal medical therapy did not control the disease! Finally, the ACST trial, which is the most vigorous piece of evidence supporting CEA for asymptomatic stenosis, now has data reporting the benefit of CEA versus medical therapy out to 10 years.This trial has been criticized because, in the earlier years of the study, optimal medical therapy was aspirin alone. However, as pointed out by the ACST investigators in the later years of the trial, more than 80% of patients were on both aspirin and a statin agent. The 10-year data from the ACST study indicate that, although the net gain in stroke prevention from CEA was proportionally larger in patients not on lipid lowering therapy, the net gain in stroke prevention at both 5 and 10 years was highly significant even in those treated with modern statin therapy, leading the ACST investigators to conclude that \u201cpatients with tight carotid stenosis cannot have the risk from it completely abolished by medical treatment alone.\u201d Despite this, it is evident that the panelists at the January 2012 CMS MEDCAC continued to have uncertainties about the relative worth of intervention versus optimal medical therapy for asymptomatic patients.A final perspective on the reluctance to accept the adequacy of medical therapy in controlling carotid stenosis is my personal \u2013 and I'm sure some will criticize as anecdotal \u2013 experience. I see over 300 patients annually referred with carotid disease and have done so for many years. The observation of progressive carotid stenosis in patients on optimal medical therapy is a common event in my practice. Accordingly, we decided to study this question. Using our health care networks' database, we identified nearly a thousand carotid arteries with duplex criteria moderate stenosis, progressively recorded all medical therapy/lipid panel data, duplex, and clinical follow out to 6 years. Some 84% of all patients were on statin medications, and over 30% of the cohort always had a normal low density lipoprotein (LDL) level. The findings were striking in that, even in patients with optimal medical therapy as defined by LDL <100 and on aspirin and statins, such therapy failed to control both lesion progression in 40% of patients and ipsilateral TIA/stroke risk which occurred at 3%/year.Thus, according to the evidence, my belief is that the claim that optimal medical therapy will control carotid atherosclerosis is not only unsubstantiated but, in fact, refuted by the available data.Intervention: The evidence favors CEACEA has been abundantly demonstrated to be a safe and effective stroke preventive strategy in contemporary practice. Whereas stroke/death risks were 7.5% in the NASCET trial, the corresponding figure was 2.6% achieved in the CREST trial.Most vascular surgeons would agree that the current favorable results of CEA can be traced to application of certain processes of care; there is now Level I evidence attesting to the benefit of patch angioplasty at least in the circumstance of a conventional CEA. The important adjunctive roles of both anti-platelet therapy and statin agents have been multiply demonstrated.Ultimately, multiple administrative database studies such as that from Dr Perler's group at Hopkins,our own SVS carotid registryand other prospective adjudicated registries such as the vascular study group of New England large study,and finally National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (NSQIP) private sector data,indicate that CEA has achieved a favorable position of clinical safety and efficacy in so-called real world experience. An NSQIP report from our group was presented at this meeting a few years ago. As you may know, NSQIP results are adjudicated at 30 days by independent nurse reviews. Favorable results (overall stroke/death \u22122.2%) for CEA in a cohort of almost 4000 such operations performed between 2005 and 2007 were noted; furthermore, the results were equivalent in so-called \u201cStenting and Angioplasty with Protection in Patients at High Risk for Endarterectomy (SAPPHIRE) high-risk\u201d patients, in particular octogenarians.A report from our group presented at the Peripheral Vascular Surgery Society (PVSS) program, reviewed early and late outcomes of over 3000 CEA performed in the 15 years prior to 2005. While the favorable short-term outcomes are quite similar to the many reports I just reviewed, the impressive data on long-term stroke prevention \u2013 which is of course the goal of therapy \u2013 is worthy of emphasis.It is my personal opinion that elements of the CEA versus CAS debate have little to do with clinical efficacy or patient safety, and the arguments are largely aligned along the different medical specialists, which, in turn, is a struggle for market share in the carotid arena. It is the SVS official position that CAS has not matured to the point that it can compete with CEA on either a safety or cost efficacy comparison. Of the perhaps 10 studies that have compared cost considerations of CEA versus CAS, all but one have come to the same conclusion as a current Oschner clinic report, that is, that CEA is more cost-effective than CAS.The negative cost implication to our health care systems of more widespread CAS use have been reviewed elsewhere.It would appear that, despite appropriately restrictive CMS reimbursement policies, that CAS is proliferating and, again, differentially among various medical specialists. A report from the University of Michigan Health Policy Unit examined physician specialty and carotid stenting use in the Medicare database between the years 2005 and 2007. The analysis was further stratified into a variety of hospital referral regions, and the study compared population-based utilization rates of CAS and 30-day outcomes for this procedure across different hospital regions and stratified by medical specialty. The findings indicate that cardiologists constitute a third of the total operators, but performed more than 50% of the procedures. Regions where cardiologists were the major operators had significantly higher population-based rates of CAS, and the performance of CAS was likely to be preceded by a cardiac catheterization but not TIA/stroke!This led the editors of theArchives of Internal Medicineto conclude that this proliferation of CAS was unjustified because of definite harms, but unclear benefits.We may be witnessing a repetition of what happened in the realm of renovascular interventions. Renal stenting grew at an alarming four-fold rate in the Medicare population over the years 1996 to 2005, despite the fact that there was no evidence base to support it. Stephen Textor, a noted nephrologist from the Mayo Clinic, wrote in theJournal of the American College of Cardiologythat the increased rates of intervention appeared to be driven largely by cardiologists rather than interventional radiologists or surgeons.So what are the comparative clinical data for CEA versus CAS? The SVS carotid registry, reported initially at this forum several years ago, offers a glimpse at real world comparative results; its outcome data are strikingly similar to CREST and, with appropriate risk adjustment, indicates significantly higher complication rates for CAS versus CEA.There are many administrative database studies with similar findings. A recent report from Dr Schemerhorn's group utilized the National Inpatient Sample database, and, similar to CREST data, the safety margin of CEA is highly significant and proportionally larger in symptomatic patients.However, focusing on asymptomatic patients, the Pittsburgh Group presented a large study utilizing California hospital discharge data. Notable in their study was rigorous risk adjustment with propensity scoring (possible because of large sample size) and the fact that only asymptomatic patients were considered. In this large study for patients treated between 2005 and 2009, stroke/death was significantly increased for CAS versus CEA (odds ratio 2.497;P< .001).With respect to randomized clinical trial data comparing CEA with carotid angioplasty and stenting, I will focus on the two largest and most recently completed trials, since overall they had the optimal trial design and execution. I refer of course to the ICSS published in theLancetin 2010,and CREST, published just about 2 years ago.Finally, figuring prominently in the SVS Clinical Practice guidelines was a 2011 meta-analysis of all the available randomized trial data conducted at the Health Policy Research Unit of the Mayo Clinic.The data indicate a significantly increased risk of stroke (relative risk [RR] 1.82) and death (RR 2.53) for CAS versus CEA. At least three other meta-analyses published in 2010 to 2011 in theBritish Medical Journal,Stroke, and theArchives of Neurologyhave identical conclusions. So to the particulars of ICSS and CREST\u2026The ICSS was a prospective randomized trial comparing CAS with CEA in average risk symptomatic patients. It was carried out in 50 academic medical centers across Europe, Australasia, and Canada. Primary outcome analysis included death, stroke, and procedure-related myocardial infarction. This composite endpoint was noted in 8.5% of patients undergoing CAS and 5.2% of those undergoing endarterectomy \u2013 a highly significant difference.It has become fashionable among North American interventionalists to denigrate this and all other European studies on the basis of possible inadequate expertise of the interventionalists participating in the study. Yet, the stroke/death rate for CAS noted in the ICSS study at about 8% is statistically no different from the 6% corresponding figure in the symptomatic patients treated in the CREST trial.Perhaps more importantly, the ICSS study was accompanied by a substudy wherein pre- and post-procedure MRI diffusion weighted imaging studies were carried out, and these data were reported inLancet Neurologyin 2010.An alarming 50% of patients (after stenting) compared with 17% (after CEA) had new MRI detected, but clinically silent micro embolic brain lesions. These differences were highly significant, and, although the implications of such micro emboli are unknown, prior studies have suggested that silent brain infarcts were accompanied by significantly more dementia and other declines in cognitive functions.Dr Wei Zhou at Stanford University has pursued the issue of the implications of silent micro emboli brain lesions. In a report delivered at the Society for Clinical Vascular Surgery (SCVS) a few months ago, Dr Wei Zhou of Stanford correlated memory decline with such micro emboli lesions.Following the ICSS trial, noted Oxford neurologist Peter Rothwell called for a moratorium on CAS, stating that \u201cthe routine use of stenting in patients with recent symptoms of carotid stenosis who are suitable for endarterectomy can no longer be justified.\u201dThe stage was then set for CREST, which, as most in this audience know, was led by a vascular surgeon, the late Dr Robert Hobson, who made many important contributions in the carotid arena. CREST began as a study of symptomatic patients, but because of slow recruitment, eventually asymptomatic patients were entered as well. The interventionalists were highly selected by an Interventional Management Committee that eventually allowed only 50% of the interventionalist applicants to eventually randomize patients. Approximately, 1200 patients were randomized in each group with a median follow-up of 2.5 years at the time the study was published. Even with initial presentation of the results at the American Heart Association Stroke meeting in February 2010, our computers were abuzz with a publicity blitz claiming equivalence for the two procedures related to the fact that the composite endpoint of death, stroke, and MI was not statistically different between the two groups.Once again, as seen in prior studies, such as the greatly flawed SAPPHIRE trial, periprocedural myocardial infarction was the outcome event that swayed the \u201cequivalence\u201d result. When the traditional endpoints of combined stroke/death are compared, the incidence of these complications following CEA was 2.6% versus 4.8% for CAS, a difference that was highly significant. The editorial accompanying the CREST publication noted that the results were broadly consistent with that in previous trials, namely that CAS was associated with a higher periprocedural risk of stroke and death, a difference that persisted at 4 years.The CREST trial participants have become, in a sense, like the Democrats and Republicans, in that each constituency has a chance to champion its particular spin on the overall trial results. For example, our cardiology colleagues have argued that periprocedural MI is a valid endpoint because those who sustained such MI had inferior 4-year survival.Stated differently, patients with worse coronary artery disease can be expected to die at higher rates than those who do not harbor same. While this consideration is intuitively logical, it is my personal opinion that attempting to mitigate procedural outcomes by inclusion of the MI endpoint is intellectually disingenuous. SVS, in its practice guidelines, placed principle emphasis on the traditional outcomes of stroke/death \u2013 a position echoed at the January CMS MEDCAC meeting. The CREST data clearly show that even a minor stroke had a significant impact on both late functional outcome and survival, with the 4-year mortality among those who suffered any stroke being 20% essentially double that for stroke-free patients. Since CAS patients had twice the stroke rate, the survival benefit of a lower MI rate is of course negated. More importantly, individual patient subset data are now available from CREST. As expected, the complication differential for CEA versus CAS is most pronounced in symptomatic patients (stroke rate CAS vs CEA: 6.0% \u00b1 0.9% vs 3.2% \u00b1 0.7%; hazard ratio 1.9,P= .02) and, as mentioned previously, in the elderly.CREST data indicate increasing superiority for CEA versus CAS at an age inflection point of approximately 70 years. It was Dr Hobson who initially, and perhaps courageously in his own CREST trial, demonstrated the increased risk of CAS in the elderly patients. It is perhaps not surprising that the available data support CEA over CAS as optimal therapy. CEA is a mature procedure with a 60-year evolution, whereas CAS is as yet undefined in the important elements of stent design and the optimal protection strategies.Thus, CAS is both evolving and the results thereof in real world practice are unsatisfactory. A recent report published in theJournal of the American Medical Associationindicates a mortality (not stroke/death, but death) for CAS in Medicare beneficiaries of nearly 2%.Yet, CAS is likely to improve, and it is imperative that vascular surgeons not only tolerate but rather lead this evolution. Distal protection has been demonstrated to be a flawed strategy in my view; engineers in the audience should take heed. An understanding of carotid bifurcation pathology, as reviewed this morning, should lead to the conclusion that the combination of a covered stent to truly exclude the necrotic plaque elements and a flow-reversal strategy (as opposed to distal protection) will be the requisite elements to enable CAS to achieve a safety profile similar to CEA. This evolution has begun; the Empire Trial, led by Dr Dan Clair, demonstrated impressive results with a stroke/death rate of under 3% in 245 high-risk patients treated with CAS using flow reversal.Preliminary data from the Protection System: First in Man (PROOF) trial indicate that a direct transcervical cut down approach to the carotid artery combined with a short sheath high flow reversal system may improve CAS greatly by elimination of endovascular manipulation in the aortic arch.The advent of a multicenter US trial testing this hypothesis is imminent; a session tomorrow morning will focus on this technology \u2026 and yes, there is some irony in the fact that I and my colleague Dr Christopher Kwolek are the study's principal investigators!What then of the current evidence-based practice? How do you advise the next patient you evaluate for carotid stenosis? You will find a surfeit of practice guidelines published in calendar year 2001, including our own.Recently, it has been debated how such guidelines, while apparently based on the same evidence base, can have such disparate recommendations \u2026 but do they, in fact?The very scholarly multispecialty guidelines endorsed by SVS provide a range of guidelines in hierarchical fashion, likely related to a \u201cneed for consensus\u201d among different medical specialists who do indeed hold very different opinions on the role of CAS.Clearly, the word \u201calternative\u201d is understood as \u201cequivalent\u201d by CAS advocates, whereas the authors of this guideline intended CEA as first-line therapy in symptomatic patients. Your SVS practice guidelines are both evidence-based and definitive in different patient subsets; I recommend them to you as the best available resource document in managing carotid disease in your practices, in particular with respect to clinical decision-making in asymptomatic patients.I should like to close on a philosophical note; you have kindly listened to elements of my story, so let's recount for a moment our story. It is embodied in an Oath we all once proclaimed, and only by remembrance of why we went into this business, can we stay grounded in the midst of all sorts of extraneous pressures. In particular, to the many about to become vascular surgeons in the audience, I believe it is important for you to hear that surgeons of my generation are not dismayed nor downtrodden. Rather, we are optimistic and encouraged. Our work is hard, often frustrating, but at the same time has the ultimate in job satisfaction. Every vascular surgeon in this room has a patient story similar to my favorite and most inspiring patient. Al was 91 years old when he had been sent home with hospice for treatment of severe back and groin pain secondary to a contained ruptured thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm. He was still driving his car around Providence, RI, and was not ready to call it quits; he had the will to live and underwent an extent II thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm replacement. He shook my hand, being quite well, on the 5th anniversary of his operation. He died just a few months ago at age 98. Ultimate job satisfaction, indeed.In my reflections as SVS president, I have thought of evolutions personal, professional, and societal. All of us can point to a few elements in our personal stories that define who we are. I remember the first family Christmas card and taking the boys fishing. I remember son Jay not only catching a beautiful striper on Martha's Vineyard, but loving its release \u2026 or son Matty catching false albacore on the Outer Banks. And my best fishing buddy, son Dan, trying to lift stripers bigger than he was \u2026 or the best night of fishing I ever had \u2013 watching an 11-year-old boy release 15 huge stripers while I never caught a one! Now, of course, he takes me fishing, on our boat, the Sea Habit, off the great backside of Cape Cod. I think of the father who guided me, just as he brought his B-25 crew home across long stretches of the Pacific with only a compass heading to steer, and the look on his face the day I graduated medical school. I think of patients like Senator Ted Kennedy who inspired me, even in the face of a dismal medical prognosis because he was guided by a \u201cTrue Compass.\u201dLeadership qualities I had to think about; a few readings helped me, and the bookTrue Northis one of them. Bill George, currently a Harvard Business School professor but formerly CEO of Medtronic, has written a series of books on the qualities of successful but moral leadership of the business world, but in fact very germane to the important role of vascular surgeons as the leaders in vascular care irrespective of your practice setting.\u201cYour truth is derived from your life story,\u201d is one of the themes, and grounding the compass pinnacle of leadership are our values and principles and our knowledge of self. I call your attention to the SVS mission statement and our core values of integrity, professionalism, and commitment to our patients. These are vascular surgery's \u201cTrue North.\u201d Be guided by them and you will find professional fulfillment as I have in our wonderful work. My fondest hope is that my tenure as SVS president has moved our specialty and our society forward.",
  "2013": "It has been a singular honor and a privilege to serve as the 67th president of this distinguished society. A true American dream, when someone born behind the Iron Curtain, raised in communist Hungary, immigrates to this great nation, joins the staff of Mayo Clinic, and completes his term as president of the most prestigious vascular surgical society in the world. It is humbling to look around the room and see hundreds of colleagues I admire, including past presidents, giants of our profession who guided us during the past decades so that today we have a society that is stronger, larger, and more vibrant than any time before. I am thankful to them for their vision and hard work. I am equally thankful to the current leadership of the Society for Vascular Surgery (SVS), to a dedicated staff and hundreds of volunteers, many here today, who helped me build a better society and strengthen our profession during this past year.Presidential addresses have dealt with many issues in the past, with our quest for excellence,with Charles Darwin and vascular surgery,with education,research,and the state of a successful union of two societies,the SVS and the American Association for Vascular Surgery (AAVS), which took place exactly 10\u00a0years ago. We were also told that results mean everythingand that to survive we must change, adopt, retrain, innovate and, at any price, remain leaders in the vascular field.Last year, president Richard Cambria's presentation was about the endovascular revolution and the current state of carotid endarterectomy and stenting, two of the many important interventions we perform.The topic I selected has been close to my heart all my life and affects each of us. It is about the very essence of why we became physicians and surgeons, why we went through years of training, took the oath of Hippocrates, and continued with further education to become vascular surgeons. Today, I would like to talk to you about our continuing mission to deliver the best vascular care to every patient, every day.To achieve this noble goal has never been easy. Today, in this country, we are faced with changes in health care\u2014likely more than at any time before. Vascular surgeons and our society need to understand and meet new challenges. We must be leaders and active participants in making and influencing important decisions affecting our patients, ourselves, our profession, and vascular health care. We need to progress and innovate, and we need funding for research and to receive fair compensation for the work we do, but we also need to stay focused on our patients without ever compromising our basic principles.My message to you is simple and applies to all of us who participate in the care of patients with vascular disease. I am asking you to remember what one of the Mayo brothers, Dr William J. Mayo () said, that the best interest of the patient is the only interest to be considered.This is essential because we took our oath and signed up to be in this profession for one ultimate goal: to deliver the best vascular care to our patients.You will understand better why I feel this is so important if you allow me to reveal some details of my personal life. I would like to tell you about those who inspired me and thank those who helped me to get where I am today. I will review some of the changes in health care and share with you my thoughts on how to meet the challenge: on a personal level, as a vascular surgeon, and with the help of an exceptional society, the SVS. Finally, I would like to share with you my thoughts of what our specialty, vascular surgery, needs to accomplish to survive, to prosper, and to lead vascular care in this country and in the world.Personal reflectionsYou heard many details of my life from Dr Julie A.\u00a0Freischlag, and you probably imagine that it was not very simple for me to get from Hungary to Rochester, Minnesota, where I have lived and practiced for the past 32\u00a0years.The PhysicianMy life's journey reminds me somewhat of the epic adventures of Rob Cole, hero of Noah Gordon's brilliant historical fiction novel,The Physician.Rob Cole, a 9-year-old boy, who feels called to be a healer, starts out in 11th century London as an apprentice to a traveling barber-surgeon. He acquires basic healing skills, but to make a living, he also has to learn how to juggle, entertain the crowd, and perform magic tricks.Against all odds, Rob stays true to his mission to become a physician. He travels through Europe to Jerusalem and then all the way to Ispahan, Persia, where he attends medical school and learns from the greatest physician of his time, Avicenna. This adventurous and inspiring tale of a quest for medical knowledge is filled with fascinating details of the medieval medical education and practice and of the life of physicians with three religions, Islam, Judaism, and Christianity.Early yearsThe journey I travelled was definitely less dangerous than that of Rob Cole, but to me, it was equally exciting and certainly eventful. I started out in Eastern Europe, in Hungary. I was born in the northeastern city of Nyiregyhaza, where my father Zolt\u00e1n and my mother Eva lived with their five children (). I was 6\u00a0years old when someone asked me what I wanted to be when I\u00a0grew up. I said \u201cprofessor of surgery.\u201d Coming from a 6-year-old, the directness of the answer was surprising, but to me, the decision was easy. I come from a family of doctors: my father, grandfather, one brother, and an uncle were all physicians.My greatest inspiration came from my father: to me, he was the best and most compassionate physician I have ever known. My sister, who is here today from Hungary, knows that our father and our beautiful and loving mother both\u00a0had great influence on us: they taught us love, hard work, honesty, and integrity. From my father, I also learned the love of medicine, love of the patient, how to strive for perfection, and why we should respect our medical colleagues. He showed me the example to continuously update our medical knowledge. I remember well at the end of long days and after seeing dozens of patients, he was regularly reading theHungarian Medical Journal. Even when I became a consultant at Mayo Clinic, he sent me articles that he snipped from his journal and underlined sentences that he thought were important. For the love and support I received from my parents, I will always be very thankful.Boarding schoolI will never forget the next stop in my journey at a boarding school in western Hungary, where I spent 4\u00a0years of my life. The school was the Benedictine High School of the Archabbey of Pannonhalma ().This historical monument was founded in 996 on the mountain of St. Martin and it is also a UNESCO (United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization) World Heritage site.For a time, I wanted to be a monk, but this did not last longer than a week, and during the rest of the 4\u00a0years of my attendance, I reinforced my plan to become a physician. I took classes to prepare for medical school, and I learned English, German, Russian, and Latin.Semmelweiss Medical SchoolMy next stop was Budapest, where I attended medical school. Founded in 1769, the school later took the name of the 19th century Hungarian physician Dr Ignaz Philipp Semmelweis (), pioneer of antisepsis and also called the savior of mothers.As early as 1847, Semmelweis introduced hand washing with bleach and drastically decreased death from puerperal fever in the Vienna General Hospital, in Austria, from 18%\u00a0to\u00a0<1%.My first surgical mentor in Budapest was one of the first Hungarian vascular surgeons, Professor Lajos Soltesz. He was a great humanist, a patient's advocate, and an inspiring teacher who taught me the tenants I have followed in my life; that vascular surgeons should take care of the full spectrum of vascular diseases, including arterial, venous, and lymphatic problems.Paris, FranceProfessor Soltesz sent me to Paris to spend time with Drs Jean-Michel Cormier and Marceau Servelle to learn the French techniques of vascular surgery, the treatment of venous diseases and lymphedema, and lymphatic microsurgery. The year I spent in France, the country that contributed so much to vascular surgery, was exciting, inspirational, and enlightening. The words that changed my life came from Servelle: \u201cMonsieur Peter,\u201d he said, \u201cthe best place in the world for medicine is Mayo Clinic.\u201d That was all I needed to know. If the best place in the world is Mayo Clinic, then that is where I have to go.Rochester, MinnesotaIt took me 6 more years, but in June 1981, I finally arrived in Rochester, Minnesota. I owe a lot to Dr Larry H. Hollier, a great surgeon and dynamic leader, first head of the Section of Vascular Surgery at Mayo Clinic. With the help of Dr Alexander Schirger, an exceptional Mayo Clinic physician, and with funds from the Bestor Fellowship, Dr Hollier took me as his research fellow. I spent a year and a half in research and then completed a clinical vascular surgery fellowship. To meet the requirements of the American Board of Surgery, I needed to repeat most of the general surgery residency I completed previously in Europe.After 15\u00a0years of wonderful surgical training, the impossible dream came true: I got a position on the staff and became a Mayo Clinic surgeon. On my road to accomplish this, three great mentors helped me: Drs Peter C. Pairolero, Kenneth J. Cherry, and John W. Hallett, who later became my colleagues and friends ().I have been blessed that during the past 25\u00a0years, I had the opportunity to work with the very best colleagues and skillful surgeons one can have, and I am thankful for their help, expertise, and friendship. I am also grateful for the opportunity to contribute to the education of 74 bright vascular surgery fellows (), and I appreciate that so many of them traveled to San Francisco to attend this meeting. You are the ambassadors of vascular surgery at Mayo Clinic, and you represent 2.6% of this country's practicing fellowship-trained vascular surgeons. Now more than any time before, I understand what Dr William J. Mayo said in 1931 that, \u201ceach day as I go through the hospitals surrounded by younger men [and I would add today: women], they give me of their dreams and I give them of my experience and I get the better of the exchange.\u201dI have been equally inspired by medical students and research fellows, many coming to learn at Mayo Clinic from far away countries (). Finally, I would like to thank again the current dedicated staff of our division () that works so hard to provide the best vascular care to every patient, every day.I have been impressed and inspired by the work ethic, expertise, and dedication of three people, all here today, who have helped me during so many years at Mayo Clinic: my scrub nurse of 24\u00a0years, Donella Rossi, CST; our Administrative Assistant of 24\u00a0years, Marcia Simonson; and my Physician Extender during the past 20\u00a0years, Linda Canton, RN, BSN, CVN. Because of them, I feel every day that my team is the dream team.My familyI would be remiss if I did not tell you how much I appreciate of having a remarkable and loving family. My son Peter is a fresh doctor of philosophy and a proud poet who recently published his first collection of poems. My daughter, Julia, completed her studies in veterinary medicine in the spring of 2013. She is also a competitive horseback rider. Ben, my son-in-law, is finishing his PhD in mathematics at UC Davis, and Michael, my stepson, is a professional artist and painter who lives in Paris, France. There is never a dull moment in this family. Still my biggest gift, coming from Paris is my wonderful wife, Monika. She tries to keep balance and peace in the family and gives me love and friendship I have never known before. She is also my coauthor, coeditor, and a perfect travel companion. Monika, thank you for everything, including your generous support of my professional life and your unbelievable patience during the busy year of my SVS presidency.Mayo ClinicBecause I spent most of my adult life in Rochester, Minnesota, I would like to say a few words about my workplace (). Mayo Clinic, founded at the turn of the last century by the Mayo family, is the first and the largest group practice in the United States. It builds on teamwork and collaboration among specialties to provide the best care to the patients and is joined by common systems and the philosophy that the needs of the patients come first. The clinic has grown and spread to Florida and Arizona, and each place has strong vascular surgery services.In Rochester, vascular disease is treated in the multidisciplinary Gonda Vascular Center. This center was made possible because of the vision and generous philanthropy of the Hungarian-born Leslie Gonda, son Louis Gonda, and their families. Their support of vascular care in this country has been exemplary: the Gonda's also sponsored a vascular center at the University of California in Los Angeles.Working with colleagues of other vascular specialties in a team can certainly be a challenge, but it is also a source of inspiration and transparence. I suspect we will see this model in large institutions more frequently in the future, and we must be certain that vascular surgeons are involved and lead. Just keep in mind: your success does not depend on failures of others. Working together enables us to develop programs that cover the full spectrum of vascular diseases: arterial, venous, and lymphatic. The focus in the Mayo Clinic model of care is on a high quality and compassionate patient care. The practice is multidisciplinary and integrated, and the three shields of the Mayo Clinic represent clinical practice, education, and research.Dr Oliver H. BeahrsI have had many role models at Mayo Clinic, but the person who inspired me most was Dr Oliver H. Beahrs, a wonderful man and one of the most dexterous surgeons the clinic has ever known. He achieved everything a surgeon can dream of, including presidency of the American College of Surgeons (,A). He described his dedication to Mayo and to American surgery in his personal memoirsand included stories of his colorful life, from being a navy pilot during World War II to his magic performances on cruise ships in Alaska: so here we are, we shared a common interest in magic.I am so proud that we have been the only two at Mayo Clinic to have a door card related to magic. I remember fondly when we performed a magic show together at the banquet of the Minnesota Surgical Society, but the real honor that I cherish dearly came later when I received the title of his named professorship. President Ronald Reagan, Dr Beahrs' patient and friend, wrote for his retirement: \u201cover the last four decades through your work with Mayo Clinic, you have touched the lives of countless many\u2026 Your efforts reflect the generous spirit of self-sacrifice and service to others that is the real source of America's strength\u201d (,B). Dr Beahrs was indeed the epitome of the American spirit of service and self-sacrifice, something that we have witnessed so well in our surgeons, emergency department physicians, nurses, and teachers during the recent catastrophes at the Boston Marathon in Massachusetts and in the devastation caused by the tornado in Moore, Oklahoma.One wonders how a great Mayo Clinic surgeon like him would react to the recent major changes in our health care. Although Mayo Clinic was always ready for a change, and as early as 1931, Dr Charles Mayo said, \u201cToday the only thing that is permanent is change,\u201dI doubt however that Dr Mayo had the Affordable Care Act in mind.Changes in health careJohn H. Noseworthy, MD, Chief Executive Officer (CEO) and President of Mayo Clinic, told us that Mayo is facing challenges unlike any we have experienced before.Gary Gottlieb, MD, President and CEO of Partners Health Care, Boston, Massachusetts, commented \u201c\u2026 there is substantial pressure to move rapidly towards improvement of public health and reduced spending of complex care.\u201dSean Leyden, MD, from Cleveland Clinic, wrote that their CEO, Dr Delos Cosgrove, made them question how they spend money, how they get patients more efficiently through the system, and how they try to keep patients out of the hospital.The Affordable Care Act was triggered to a large extent by the increasing costs of health care in the United States vs other countries in the world.The pressure to change further increased when a World Health Organization (WHO) report in 2000 ranked health care in the United States 37th in the world, placing our country somewhere between Costa Rica and Slovenia.This low total score was assigned despite ranking first in the only category that really counted, \u201cresponsiveness to the needs of the patient.\u201d In categories such as \u201cfinancial fairness,\u201d countries with government-paid care ranked high, even if the care the patients received was poor.Just 1\u00a0month after the Affordable Care Act was approved, Dr Philip Musgrove wrote in a letter to theNew England Journal of Medicine, \u201cThere are sound reasons to mistrust the conceptual framework behind the estimates. And that it is long past time for this zombie number to disappear from circulation.\u201dThis was a peculiar and quite late statement coming from the editor of the very same WHO report that spoke up so harshly about the health care in this country. Health experts like Betsy McCaugheyalso call attention to data that prove that money for research in this country was well spent: in the past 113\u00a0years, scientists from the United States have won more Nobel prizes in physiology and medicine than the rest of the world combined ().But new health care is now and is here to stay, with noble goals to reduce health care costs, to increase the rate of health insurance coverage, and to decrease insurance premiums. Instead of fee-for-service that has been a volume-based reimbursement, providers will receive global payments for taking care of people over time (value-based reimbursement). The goal is to improve outcomes and streamline delivery of health care.Vascular surgeons and the Affordable Care ActSo how are vascular surgeons affected in the Affordable Care Act? We will pay more taxes, and we will also pay a penalty after 2015 if we do not participate in the Physician Quality Reporting System (PQRS). Codes will be re-evaluated, payment for multiple procedures will decrease, and the Independent Payment Advisory Board will have the rights to cut payment to vascular surgeons. Earlier this year, a 2% cut for Medicare patients was enacted.The focus will be on primary care. The idea is that enhancing preventive care will eventually decrease health care costs. Funding will be shifted from specialists to primary care, and this will affect training and reimbursements of vascular surgeons.Meeting the challengeSeveral solutions are available that will help us in meeting this challenge. We need to participate in an approved clinical data registry, such as the SVS Vascular Quality Initiative (VQI). We need to use electronic health records and electronic prescriptions, report radiation exposure times, report the methods we use to calculate carotid artery stenosis, and our surveillance after endovascular repair of aortic aneurysms. We can use any of the other already approved measures as well.Voice your concern, just as Dr Frank J. Veith did in a recent issue of theVascular Specialist,where he made a point that \u201cprimary care physicians don't get patients well.\u201dReferring to vascular surgeons, Dr Veith said that, \u201cThese skilled specialists have to work hard and devote years and long hours of training\u2026, they have to be available 24/7 to provide emergency treatment when minutes and hours make a difference\u2026, they deserve to be highly compensated in keeping with other professions that have similar requirements.\u201dAfter discussing this with our SVS health policy experts, Drs Robert M. Zwolak and Sean P. Roddy, we came up with a number of suggestions on how vascular surgeons could succeed in the Affordable Care Act. Needless to say, we need to maintain and develop the widest possible expertise in open surgical and endovascular procedures, including access, amputations, spine exposures, and in all\u00a0aspects of a vascular laboratory. This will make us indispensable. We should never forget how to perform the highest-quality open vascular surgery, because no one else can do it. We need to focus on treating the disease. If that means learning to inject stem cells or perform embolization, endothermal venous ablations, or sclerotherapy, so be it.Vascular surgeons should also be familiar with values in health care and remember the equation: value means quality, safety, and service divided by cost. It will be more and more difficult to justify procedures that are not cost-effective. Our advice to you is that you learn how to be team players and leaders in big medical center environments. Retain recognition as honest brokers at national legislative and regulatory venues, and most importantly, seek and train people who want to do great work by being a great doctor and earning a good wage and not just a good doctor earning a great wage. As Steve Jobs once shared, your work is not for money and \u201cyour work is going to fill a large part of your life, and the only way to be truly satisfied is to do what you believe is great work.\u00a0And, the only way to do great work is to love what you do.\u201dThe Society for Vascular SurgeryOur society is a societyforvascular surgery, so what can SVS do to meet the challenge? Let me tell you first what many of you already know, that SVS is an organization with great traditions, strong programs, and a bright future. Historically, we are connected to our host city of San Francisco, where on July 3, 1946, nine visionary surgeons, Drs Michael E. DeBakey, Daniel C. Elkin, Norman E. Freeman, Emile Holman, John Homans, Robert R. Linton, Alton Ochsner Sr, Geza de Takats, and J. Ross Veal founded SVS. The first meeting the following year was organized in Atlantic City. Of the founding fathers, the gentleman who inspired me most was Dr Geza de Takats.Dr Geza de TakatsGeza de Takats (,A) was born in Budapest, Hungary, on December 9, 1892, where he went to medical school and completed his surgical residency. He immigrated to the United States and first worked at Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota, as a traveling fellow of the Rockefeller Foundation. In 1925, he settled in Chicago and worked as a surgical fellow under Dr Allan B. Kanavel. He later became the head of the vascular clinics at Northwestern University and then at the University of Illinois.His interest in vascular diseases was broad and included aneurysms and vascular grafts, venous disease, varicose veins, thrombosis, fibrinolysis, sympathectomy, and lymphedema.He wrote one of the first textbooks on vascular surgery (,B).I received a copy of his book from my partner and good friend Dr Kenneth Cherry, who noted in his dedication that \u201c\u2026 there must be something to be a Hungarian and a great and pioneering vascular surgeon.\u201d Dr Cherry obviously referred to Dr Geza de Takats, who became the seventh president of the SVS 60\u00a0years ago.But he was also thinking of another great Hungarian vascular surgeon, Dr D. Emerick Szilagyi (), who 30\u00a0years ago, right here in San Francisco, was the 37th president of our society.Dr D. Emerick SzilagyiBorn on June 20, 1910, in Transylvania, territory of Austria-Hungary, D. Emerick Szilagyi (1910-2009) started medical school at the Sorbonne in Paris, France.He continued his medical studies in Debrecen, Hungary, at the same medical school where my father, Zolt\u00e1n, started his studies just a few years later. He immigrated to the United States and then graduated from the University of Michigan in 1935. Szilagyi completed his surgical residency at Henry Ford Hospital in Detroit and became a member of and, in 1966, Chairman of the Department of Surgery.Dr Szilagyi was Editor-In-Chief of theJournal of Vascular Surgeryand 37th president of the SVS. He wrote seminal papers on aortic aneurysms, homografts, prosthetic grafts, and vein grafts, and made important contributions to the literature on arteriovenous malformations.His presidential addresses discussed the role and importance of\u00a0the art of medicine, the historical development and challenges of physician-patient relationships, and the significance of truth in scientific reporting.Art, compassion, surgical skills, leadership, wisdom, and integrity: these terms summarize the legacy of Dr D. Emerick Szilagyi. Shortly after completing his memoirs,he passed away in 2009, at age\u00a099.The new SVSA transforming event in the life of the SVS occurred 10\u00a0years ago when the society united with the AAVS. A new society was born that kept the name of SVS. The merger, which was documented in great detail by Dr Jack L. Cronenwett,turned out to be the best move the society has ever made. Ten years later, we are financially strong, with an increase in assets of 155% (.). Our membership has doubled in 10\u00a0years (). If this year's candidates are approved at our business meeting, the growth will be 110%, with a large increase in our international memberships: we now have eight international chapters. Our new office in Chicago started out with three administrators in 2003, we had seven people there in 2007, and today, our two offices in Chicago and Washington, D.C., have a professional staff of 22 members. The SVS governance has also grown, the board works with five councils and 33 committees or work groups to serve our constituents. I am grateful to have worked with an extraordinary group of dedicated surgeons and staff and appreciated very much the superb leadership of our executive director, Rebecca Maron. Read the SVS annual report to learn what this society is doing for you, because in this address, I will only hit some of the highlights.SVS activities in 2012-2013Patient Safety OrganizationThe SVS Patient Safety Organization (PSO) was approved last year. It is now listed among 75 PSOs by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) and was cited at its annual meeting as a leader in quality improvement. The program has grown by leaps and bounds. We collect data from 228 centers in 45 states and Ontario, Canada. We have 15 regional groups and several more are in the pipeline. Data on almost 90,000 procedures have already been collected, and each month, >4000 new cases are added. We extended VQI to venous disease, and with representatives from the American Venous Forum, we established a Venous Quality Committee. In February, we released the inferior vena cava filter module, and additional modules are in preparation and will be introduced soon.Issues in venous diseaseWe all can be very proud of the new journal started in January 2013 in collaboration with the American Venous Forum, theJournal of Vascular Surgery: Venous and Lymphatic Disorders. Another initiative took place in February when the SVS and the Society for Interventional Radiology formed a joint foundation and announced the upcoming Predicting the Safety and Effectiveness of Inferior Vena Cava Filters (PRESERVE) study, the first large-scale North American multispecialty prospective study to evaluate the use of inferior vena cava\u00a0filters.Outcome CommitteeThe SVS Outcome Committee succeeded in bringing together all stakeholders for the postapproval assessment of thoracic endografts used for treatment of acute, complicated, type B aortic dissection. Dr Rodney A. White, Dorothy B. Abel, and others published key papers earlier this year to answer the question why an investigator-sponsored investigational device exemption is required to conduct Food and Drug Administration-approved clinical studies of significant risk devices.Clinical Practice CouncilOur Clinical Practice Council, chaired by Dr Ruth Bush, has worked with several committees. To assist our private practice physicians, the Community Practice Committee, under the leadership of Dr Richard A. Lynn, presented valuable documents on compensation plans and practice mergers at the SVS Web site ().The SVS Women Leadership Committee, chaired by Dr Eva M. Rzucidlo, is concerned with women's health, and in April 2013, published aJournal of Vascular Surgerysupplement on this topic. Diversity and inclusion have become core values of our society in our new strategic plan.Educational CouncilThe SVS is proud of the numerous educational activities overseen by our Education Council under the leadership of Dr Cynthia E. Shortell. These include the Vascular Annual Meeting, organized with Program Chair Dr Ronald M. Fairman, our postgraduate courses (Chair: Dr Jon Matsumura), the SVS/Society of Thoracic Surgeons/American Association for Thoracic Surgery Symposium (Chairs: Drs Roy K. Greenberg and Lars Swenson), the Vascular Review Course (Drs Cynthia E. Shortell and William D. Jordan), the Coding and Reimbursement Courses (Chair: Dr Sean P. Roddy), and the Vascular Research Initiative Conference (Chair: Dr Alan Dardik). We are working on our Continuing Medical Education tracking system, Vascular Education and Self-Assessment Program (VESAP) 1 and 2 have been most successful, and VESAP 3 is in full preparation by Drs Kim J. Hodgson and John F. Eidt, just as is the 8th Edition ofRutherford's Vascular Surgery, expertly edited by Drs Jack L. Cronenwett and K. Wayne Johnston.Research CouncilOur Research Council, chaired by\u00a0Dr Larry W. Kraiss, published on our Vascular Research Initiative conferences and on high-impact clinical research priorities of the SVS.This year, we supported the Society for Vascular Nursing Carotid Guidelines and the American College of Cardiology Guidelines on Venous Ultrasound and Physiologic Testing. The SVS Document Oversight Committee, chaired by Dr Wayne Johnston, just approved the Adverse Events Reporting Standards (Part 1). Close to completion are the multidisciplinary Ulcer Guidelines and the first part of our Peripheral Arterial Disease (PAD) Guidelines. Many more projects are in preparation.Health Policy CommitteeIn the era of new health care, our Health Policy Committee has taken on an increasingly important role. The charge of this committee is to determine SVS positions on legislative and regulatory issues with impact on vascular surgeons and their patients. They monitor and participate in advocacy efforts for Medicare physician payment reform, removal of the Sustainable Growth Rate formula, and creation of payment reform recommendations for vascular surgery. They also monitor and participate in removing barriers to abdominal aortic aneurysm screening, averting additional cuts to vascular ultrasound screening, repealing the Independent Payment Advisory Board, and supporting comprehensive medical liability reform.I am proud to say that the SVS Board approved a Medicare Physician Payment Plan, which has been presented to members of the House Energy and Commerce and of the Ways and Means Committees. Dr Sean P. Roddy's presentation was well received this April at the Surgical Coalition Meeting in Washington, D.C.New strategic planAfter a successful retreat in January by the SVS leadership, a new strategic plan was presented to the board by President-Elect Dr Julie A. Freischlag. The plan, approved just 2\u00a0days ago, contains six\u00a0major strategic goals for our society to accomplish ().The specialty of vascular surgeryLet me share with you my thoughts on how the specialty of vascular surgery will meet the challenge of the next 5 to 10\u00a0years. Dr Valentine and colleaguesrecently reported the evolving patterns of vascular surgery in the United States. Case logs of surgeons seeking recertifications from 2007 to 2009 were reviewed and major vascular cases of general and vascular surgeons were compared. General surgeons perform an average of 10 major vascular cases compared with 192 by vascular surgeons. This difference was even more striking when endovascular cases were counted. Because the evidence is overwhelming that most general surgeons no longer do major vascular cases, we need to grow as a specialty to meet future needs.Vascular surgery trainingFortunately, vascular surgery training programs in North America are excellent. Our specialty is now one of the most competitive fields for applicants. We train 250 residents in 104 independent vascular surgery programs. There are 45 integrated (0/5) residency programs with 97 residents, and six new programs were approved just this year. Because we have already identified 40 new potential sites, we expect the number of 0/5 programs will double during the next 3\u00a0years. The future of vascular surgery is bright!Leaders in aortic and peripheral vascular careFew would argue that the specialty of vascular surgery has a long\u00a0and proven record of providing diagnosis, prevention, and comprehensive high-quality open surgical and endovascular care to vascular patients. We are experts in aortic, visceral artery, and carotid reconstructions. Vascular surgery maintains a leading position among specialties treating patients with PAD. In a recent report based on Medicare claims, vascular surgeons in the last decade exceeded cardiology and radiology in the number of endovascular procedures placing stents for PAD in the United States ().Leaders in venous diseaseIn addition to treating arterial diseases, we also treat patients with a wide spectrum of disorders of the venous and lymphatic system. An SVS survey found that 93% of the responding members treated superficial veins and 86% also treated deep vein problems.Evidence is growing on the effectiveness of endovascular procedures in treating patients with acute deep vein thrombosisand with chronic large vein obstructions.Among the increasing number of different specialties dealing with superficial venous problems, vascular and general surgeons do most endovenous ablation procedures for varicose veins and more advanced forms of chronic venous insufficiency.Venous diseases have always been close to my heart. During several decades of venous practice, I was fortunate enough to treat a large number of patients, and some of them had most rewarding\u2014if not spectacular\u2014outcomes after surgical treatment. Let me share with you very briefly the cases of three athletes I treated.I remember well the first patient, a 39-year-old intensive care unit nurse, who presented with a 10-year history of painful leg ulcers that prevented him from practicing his favorite life-long hobby, long-distance running. His ulcers healed after the superficial endoscopic perforator vein surgery procedure and skin grafting.Three years later, he completed the Alaska Equinox, one of the most difficult marathons in the United States.I also recall the pain and problems of another athlete, a 55-year-old man, who had post-thrombotic syndrome and venous claudication after femoral vein thrombosis. He underwent saphenopopliteal transposition (May-Husni procedure) with excellent clinical outcomeand was able to return to run marathons, even super marathons.Finally, the third patient I would like to mention was one of the most courageous young women I have ever operated on. She had severe symptoms of superior vena cava syndrome and needed open surgical reconstructions. A few years later, she sent me an article with her smiling picture as she was crossing the finish line of the San Francisco marathon.The outcomes in these patients were wonderful, but they were also symbolic to vascular surgery because they help us answer the question: Why will our specialty succeed in the Affordable Care Act? Here are my answers:We will succeed because treatment of vascular patients is a marathon and not a sprint. We will succeed because we know about value, quality, safety, service, and costs. Our tools are more than the basic \u201chammer and nail\u201d\u2014we provide comprehensive care to our patients, care that they need and, more importantly, they deserve: be it medical, surgical, or endovascular care. Vascular surgeons do what is\u00a0right, for the right reason, at the right time, with the right tools.Now it is our timeSo my message to you is, \u201cNow it is our time!\u201d The services we provide have high value: we save lives, we save limbs, we prevent stroke, and we heal and prevent ulcers, and treat and prevent life-threatening and disabling venous thromboembolism. We work together with and help other surgical specialties, and by providing medical treatment of PAD, we prevent cardiovascular disease. I know from my own experience that vascular surgeons can retrain and become \u201cendocompetent.\u201d Our patients need new, minimally invasive procedures. Our responsibility is to ensure these procedures are also equally or more effective than conventional surgical operations.During the last 60\u00a0years, vascular surgeons transformed the dismal natural history of untreated aortic aneurysmal disease, as once reported by Estesand by Szilagyi et\u00a0al.We adopted and, together with an enthusiastic medical device industry, rapidly developed endovascular aortic aneurysm repairs. These procedures are less invasive and equally or more effective than open surgical treatment. Largely due to the increased number of endovascular repairs, risk-adjusted early mortality after abdominal aortic aneurysm repairs in the United States between 1999 and 2008 was reduced by 36%, from 4.4% to 2.8%.According to the latest National Vital Statistics Report, mortality from aortic aneurysms and dissections in the United States decreased by 23%, from 12,986 in 2007 to 10,030 in 2011.So we save lives and continue to be leaders in vascular care.We also need to remain a profession with a continuing quest for excellence.We perfected comparative effectiveness in vascular care,and we have long known that results mean everything.My message to you is to remind you to keep in mind the platinum rule of medicine: that we \u201ctreat every patient like you'd want a member of your family treated!\u201dRemember what Dr William J. Mayo once said, \u201cthe best interest of the patient is the only interest to be considered.\u201dWe are fortunate to belong to the Society for Vascular Surgery, an organization that cares about its members, radiates excellence, integrity, innovation, and professionalism, and advocates so effectively on behalf of vascular patients and vascular surgeons. A society for the best vascular care for every patient, every day. It has been an extraordinary privilege to serve as president of this distinguished society, and I thank you for the honor!",
  "2014": "Thank you for the wonderful honor of serving as your president during the past year and giving me the special privilege of addressing our members at the annual meeting. I have attended nearly every annual meeting since I was a fellow and owe much of my career to the friends I make, knowledge I gain, and inspiration I experience at the meetings. The Society for Vascular Surgery (SVS) is an important organization with tremendous responsibility to its members, patients, and the health of our nation. I deeply enjoyed the opportunity to help lead the Society in making a difference and advancing the education, training, and research that supports our profession.My presidential address included many firsts. I am the first woman president to deliver the address, I shared results of the Society's first Strategic Plan, and for the first time a patient told his story on stage. My mentors and family sat in the front, my family joined me at the podium so I could acknowledge their support, and my presentation theme was something we do not do in vascular surgery\u2014take chances. I selected \u201cChances\u201d because there is a positive aspect about chance that influences our lives. For example, I became president because you gave me the chance to serve and I took that chance. There are chances that we all should be giving to patients, colleagues, trainees, and even people we do not know. Most important, we need to take chances for ourselves.SVS strategic planIt is difficult to single out one undertaking in 2013 that was the most significant, yet I believe developing the Society's first Strategic Plan was of utmost importance to the future of our organization. The plan is similar to a basic instrument set for vascular surgery because it is an essential component of everything we do. Every day we are led by its purpose\u2014promote vascular health through advancing the science and practice of vascular disease management\u2014and guided by its values\u2014integrity, commitment to quality, relevance to members, leadership, diversity and inclusivity, and professionalism.The Strategic Plan required hundreds of hours of meetings, phone calls, status reports, and\u2014most of all\u2014teamwork. The Society's staff went above and beyond to add the complex project to their already full plates, and many members volunteered their time and energy to help complete the plan. Together, we demonstrated the outstanding commitment and capability of the Society and its members. I am proud that we did more than complete the plan; we implemented it. In my address, I explained the plan's goals and described examples of progress for each goal. Thesummarizes the information.I am excited about the Strategic Plan because it establishes priorities, directs resources, tightens operations, aligns everyone's efforts toward shared goals, and guides the Society's path during times of challenge and change. The concerted and disciplined project raised fundamental philosophical and operational questions that helped define the Society\u2014who it serves, what it does, and why and how it measures success. Throughout the process, we learned more about where we are, where we need to go, and how we will get there. We discovered what works and what needs improvement. Most important, we saw vast opportunities for achieving further greatness. I look forward to continuing to help the Society seize its promising future.ChancesThe Strategic Plan does more than help the Society; it also lays the foundation for creating and enhancingchancesfor our patients to lead healthier lives, students and residents to receive innovative education and training, researchers to make breakthrough discoveries, colleagues to develop rewarding and fulfilling careers, and each of us to open new windows of opportunity in our personal and professional lives. Giving chances to others and taking chances for ourselves helps move everyone from one step to the next. Giving chances demonstrates the humanity in our character, and taking chances improves our strength and resilience for achieving our dreams. Both are essential skills that help us lead others\u2014and ourselves.Taking advantage of the power of chance requires focusing on three aspects of chance: (1) understanding the role that chance plays in shaping our careers and the careers of others, (2) contemplating the possible outcomes of taking a chance or giving a chance to another person, and (3) reflecting on successes that have occurred because of chance. My favorite quote about chance is, \u201cIn this world, we have to take chances. Sometimes they're worth it and sometimes they're not. But I am telling you now, you will never know until you try.\u201d For example, two fantastic parts of my life involved taking chances. I took a chance on a dating service that introduced me to my husband, Phil, and it has been worth it now 21\u00a0years later! And I became president of the Society because you gave me the chance to serve and I took that chance.Taking chances is the key to an exciting and fruitful life, and giving chances is the secret to a rewarding and fulfilling career.\u2022To give our patients a chance, we must become and continue to be excellent physicians. We need to listen to our patients, care about them, and fret about them before, during, and after surgery.\u2022Giving colleagues chances means we must be good team members, do what we said we would do, and demonstrate integrity.\u2022We must find, create, and give chances to the fellows, residents, and students who we teach and train.\u2022And we must turn around and reach out to those coming up behind us, pull them to our side, mentor them as we were mentored, and cheer them forward. We must take the chance and give them a chance of a lifetime.We must keep in mind that we cannot effectively do for others what we do not do well for ourselves. We cannot be afraid to take chances in our own lives. I ponder whether I should take a particular chance, but I do not allow concerns about success or failure to prevent me from taking chances. Professionally, we can learn a new surgical or research procedure, take on new responsibilities, attend leadership courses (eg, those offered by SVS), or consider a new position\u2014I did! We can take a chance by asking a colleague, resident, or student to partner on a project. For example, Kendall Likes has worked with me since she was 16. She recently graduated from college and presented my research paper the day after my presidential address.At home, we can ask a child, spouse, significant other, or friend to join us in the excitement of taking a chance on doing something new. Phil and I are now biking on the American River trails in Sacramento, which is something we never expected to do. This is an example of how taking a chance\u2014I took a chance on a new position in Sacramento at the University of California\u2014can unveil an invigorating world of chances that you did not know existed. I also believe there are chances in our everyday lives that we seldom embrace, such as character-building chances to meet someone new, to lend a helping hand, or to bring a smile to someone's day. My emphasis on the humanity of sharing chances is based on the quote, \u201cTo the world you may be one person; but to one person you may be the world.\u201dExperience has taught me that life is a river of chances that stops for no one. We can watch it flow by from the shore, team with someone who can help us slowly get wet, or jump in on our own with full gusto and ride an adventure that welcomes whatever happens next! Wherever the river's turns have taken me, I have always had the same ultimate destination\u2014be the leader that people want to follow more because of who I am than what I accomplish. I have a plaque in my office that states \u201cBecause Nice Matters\u201d\u2014because that is who I am. It is my promise, it is how I practice medicine, and it is how I direct my life's mission.My life has been full of amazing chances\u2014chances I developed myself, chances that were given to me, and chances that I have taken. Most important, the chances that I embarked on have created more and better chances for those in my footsteps. My lifetime of chances began with going to college to become a high-school biology teacher, but the program closed because too many students wanted to be teachers. My love of science led me to the pre-med program with a goal of becoming a pediatrician.I did my surgery clerkship first to get it out of the way because I thought I would not like it. By chance, I enjoyed surgery, changed direction, and attended the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) to train to be the best vascular surgeon I could be. Dr Steven Economou gave me the pivotal chance by recommending that I do surgery. Drs Donald Morton, Wesley S. Moore, and Ronald Busuttil gave me many chances to expand my skills and knowledge in UCLA's general and vascular surgery departments; Drs A. R. Moosa, Bruce E. Stabile, Marc Sedwitz, and Robert J. Hye gave me the chance to be assistant professor at the University of California, San Diego; and Drs Michael J. Zinner, Wesley S. Moore, and Edward Passaro, Jr, provided the chance for me to join their team as assistant professor at UCLA.Developing my leadership career followed a road that was lined with excellent chances. Sometimes I had to create and seek out chances, and other times nice people presented them to me or pointed out the ones I might not have considered without their support and encouragement. Many chances also emerged as a result of my hard work, dedication, and enthusiasm. I have learned that chances come in all shapes and sizes and we have to be careful not to miss those that do not meet our preconceived expectations. I do not view chances as ends in themselves; instead, I assess each one for its potential to contribute to the ongoing journey of my life in new and exciting ways.For example, I whole-heartedly took chances on leadership roles serving as Chief of Vascular Surgery at the West Los Angeles VA, Chief of Surgery at Zablocki VA Medical Center in Milwaukee, Chief of Vascular Surgery at UCLA, and Chair of Surgery at Johns Hopkins. Many inspirational people influenced these chances for my career advancement, including Drs Robert E. Condon, Jonathan B. Towne, E. Carmack Holmes, Wesley S. Moore, and Edward Miller. I have experienced that you run out of chances only when you stop taking them.I did not fully appreciate the significance at the time, but I was the sixth woman to finish General Surgery at UCLA, the second woman vascular fellow at UCLA, the sixth woman in the United States to receive her vascular board certificate, and the first woman faculty on staff at the University of California, San Diego, and UCLA. I became the only woman serving as a Vascular Surgery Division Chief (from 1998 to 2003), the first woman Chair of the Department of Surgery and Chief of Surgery at Johns Hopkins, the first woman Chair of the Board of Regents of the American College of Surgeons, and the first woman president and immediate past president of the Society for Vascular Surgery.Looking in the rear-view mirror at the places I have been, the responsibilities I have had, and the people who helped make it all possible, I am surprised by the large number of chances\u2014some serendipitous and others targeted\u2014that came together as pieces of the puzzle. Combined, they prepared me to take a new position at the University of California, Davis, to serve as the Vice Chancellor for Human Health Sciences and Dean of the School of Medicine. Unfortunately, in the same rear-view mirror, I see the reality that most of the people who filled my career with chances are men.My current position is the first time that I can credit the power of chance to women in leadership roles. Not only did Linda Katehi, Chancellor of the University of California, Davis, give me a chance by hiring me, she also co-chaired the recruiting committee with Diana Farmer, Chair of the Department of Surgery\u2014one of only six women chairs of surgery presently in the United States. I am proud and fortunate to be at an institution with a culture that improves chances for women to lead. I cannot adequately express the profound joy I experienced when all members of the surgery team for my first case at the University of California, Davis, were women!The men who gave me chances throughout my career\u2014and continue to do so\u2014are extraordinary role models for stepping forward to help women succeed. We know there are not enough women vascular surgeons, and too few are in leadership roles that enable them to champion enough chances for other women. More men need to follow my male mentors' lead\u2014take a chance by giving chances to women, help them pursue those chances, and celebrate their successes. Men need to help women, women need to help women, and we all need to help each other access the chances that make a difference in our careers so we can go out and make a difference in our patients' lives. Advancing chances for women helps generate interest in our profession and maintains the prestige that our Society gained when members selected their first woman president.My personal and professional goal is to leverage the chances that I take to help improve chances for others. I accept the obligation to circumspectly view chances in the context of the impact that I can have on others by taking chances\u2014not just look at chances through a lens that focuses only on the benefits to me. Taking full advantage of a chance depends on capturing its larger transformational power for the benefit of all. For example, I evaluate my chances in terms of how I can help encourage more women to become vascular surgeons. Our profession's recent milestones in this shared effort include the following:\u2022The number of women vascular surgery trainees increased 437% since 2007.\u2022The integrated vascular surgery program ranks seventh in the percentage of women residents (after obstetrics and gynecology, pediatrics, dermatology, medical genetics, internal medicine, and physical medicine and rehabilitation), and the number of women increased from 18% to 38% between 2008 and 2013.\u2022In 2007, there were 2426 male and 183 women vascular surgeons. In 2010, the number of men increased by 203 and women increased by 40. While the increase is good news, it should be better in light of data that show the number of active male surgeons (including general, neurologic, orthopedic, plastic, thoracic, and vascular surgery) decreased by 988 while women increased by 704.Progress has been made and more has yet to be achieved. As individuals and collectively as the Society for Vascular Surgery, we have an obligation to make a lasting difference that matters to each of us, to future generations of vascular surgeons, and to our patients. We all must take a chance to do our part in leading the way forward. As leaders of chance and change, we need to be real\u2014act with authenticity and clarify what is important; we need to be whole\u2014act with integrity and respect the whole person; and we need to be innovative\u2014act with creativity and experiment with how things get done.Taking a chance to lead requires finding and knowing your inner voice, listening and attending to others, telling thought-provoking stories, nurturing a shared vision, energizing innovative thinking, and cultivating an organization's creative imagination. Effective leaders inspire through their hearts, as well as minds, by sharing the deeper purpose and meaning of doing good work and serving others. Poetry is an excellent guide for the inner journey that uncovers and strengthens the soulful qualities of truly great leaders.Most important, leaders must model the behavior they ask of others. When I was six, my grandfather told me that I could do anything I wanted to do even though some people would tell me I cannot. Every time I give someone a chance, I remember his words and make sure that the chance I provide will help the person do evenmorethan they thought they could do.When I help people pursue chances, I ask them to close their eyes, imagine where they will be in 15\u00a0years, and contemplate how they will get there.And then I ask them to think about the definitive factor\u2014how do they want to be remembered? I also explain that taking chances involves choice. We can choose to ignore or to take chances for ourselves; we can choose to create chances for others or wait for them to ask; and we can choose to be exhilarated by chances or fear them. Whenever debating a chance, my strongest advice is found in Robert Frost's poem titled \u201cThe Road Less Taken.\u201dTwo roads diverged in a yellow wood,And sorry I could not travel bothAnd be one traveler, long I stood \u2026I shall be telling this with a sighSomewhere ages and ages hence:Two roads diverged in a wood, and I,I took the one less traveled by,And that has made all the difference.Thank you for giving me the chance to be the first woman to travel the presidential road at the Society for Vascular Surgery. Thank you for creating the chance for us to be brave together in achieving another first for the Society. And thank you from the bottom of my heart for granting me the honor and privilege of being your president.",
  "2015": "In January 2015,The New York Timesreported on a physician in Florida who collected $18 million in 1\u00a0year from Medicare, of which $13 million was received for performing arterial interventions on legs. The reporters questioned whether the lack of oversight in office-based procedural centers was leading to patients being subjected to too many vascular procedures, both venous and arterial.Of course, that physician denied there was any relationship between the lack of oversight and overtreatment, using as evidence that he had the lowest amputation rate in the entire country. He completely missed the point\u2014this article was not about his technical skills or outcomes\u2014it was about the appropriateness of his indications and whether he was overtreating patients with a high-cost procedure, when they may only have needed an exercise program\u2014or even nothing. It's easy to get great results in a patient who needs nothing done!Representing the views of the Society for Vascular Surgery (SVS), I provided a 175-word statement toThe New York Times.We decided to take on the elephant in the room\u2014the current system that fosters unnecessary and inappropriate vascular procedures, and we pointed out that some of us, including vascular surgeons, are tempted to perform unnecessary care because the environment and incentives are wrong. The letter received more responses from SVS members than any communication in the history of our society\u2014over 500; you asked that this issue not be swept under the rug, so I am continuing that process today and have incorporated many of your thoughts and suggestions into my talk.I will discuss the extent of the problem, the possible causes, and then some proposals for reducing the frequency with which inappropriate care is provided to vascular patients. What surprised me most was the consistency of our SVS members' responses to theNew York Timesarticle\u2014not a single person disagreed with the basic point of the letter, even some whom I knew were occasionally performing \u201cunnecessary\u201d procedures! They seemed to be asking us to help develop a better system. Some thought that I should have been more critical, some wanted the letter more nuanced, and most wanted it longer\u2014not realizing that it would not get published inThe New York Timesunless it was fewer than 175 words, which is not much space to address such an important issue.This article brought to mind a very thought-provoking book by a fellow surgeon and MacArthur genius, Atul Gawande:Better: A Surgeon's Notes on Performance,in which he discusses how some of the most challenging health care problems have been solved, areas where we have become \u201cbetter.\u201d For those of you who, like me, started practicing in the 1980s, you know that there has not been a field of medicine with more progress than vascular disease management. But, you also know that at the same time that we have developed the capability to treat vascular patients \u201cbetter,\u201d we, meaning the global community of vascular specialists, have also treated many patients \u201cworse\u201d\u2014by overtreating them with procedures that they do not need, just because we have the technology; for example, patients with mild claudication with superficial femoral artery occlusions undergoing angioplasties or atherectomies, patients with minimal venous reflux undergoing ablation of multiple veins, and patients with small asymptomatic aneurysms being treated with endografts. Some of these procedures are not durable, so that patients, once treated, often require repeated procedures. These unnecessary and nondurable procedures have led to huge costs for our health care system, occasionally cause complications for patients, and many are done primarily for our own personal economic gain. So, my talk today is \u201c\u2018Better' (sometimes) in vascular disease management.\u201d It is the story of economics, technology, competition, and ethics.We know that this is not an entirely new issue for surgery. Lucian Leape, the father of the modern quality movement in surgery, estimated in a review published in 1989 that 20% of all surgical procedures were unnecessary,andUSA Todayran an investigative report in 2013 in which they estimated that up to 70% of recommended surgical procedures in some fields of surgery were \u201cunnecessary.\u201dAnd, in our own field of vascular disease management, one of the early clues to the extent of the problem comes from theDartmouth Atlas of Vascular Procedures, published in 2002 by Cronenwett and Birkmeyer.It showed the great variation in common vascular procedures, based on hospital referral region and zip code, with some areas having double the rate of those with a similar disease burden (). Although it was difficult to determine if the problem was primarily caused by the overuse of procedures in some regions, or also due to a dearth of vascular surgeons in others, the degree of variation was great enough to suggest a significant problem. And at last year's Crawford symposium, entitled \u201cAppropriate Care in Vascular Disease Management,\u201dDr Robert Zwolak showed us a graph, which I have updated with this year's data, on the increase in venous ablation procedures over the past 10\u00a0years (). Even those who argue that venous ablation is \u201cdisruptive technology\u201d and that many patients came out of the woodwork when these minimally invasive devices were developed, find it hard to accept a 4529% increase in venous ablation procedures without attributing a significant number to overtreatment. Russell Samson, editor ofVascular Specialistwho has often \u201chit the nail on the head\u201d in his editorials, proposed a new society\u2014\u201cSave Our Saphenous,\u201da takeoff on the \u201cSave the Whale\u201d society for another endangered species, to prevent treatment of normal saphenous veins!Virtually all of the increase in vascular procedures comes from office-based sites, with a shift toward nonvascular surgeons performing many of these procedures. New devices allow virtually any physician to treat some venous diseases\u2014they're minimally invasive, reimburse well, are readily accepted by patients, and have no barrier to entry when done in an office. But, these increases in office-based procedures are not limited to venous disease; similar data on lower extremity arterial procedures (), only collected since 2011, demonstrate the dramatic increase in atherectomy, and there is a similar increase in venous stent procedures (). Physicians who never had formal residency training in vascular disease management have learned one or two vascular procedures and have started very lucrative practices in their office, with no oversight of either their indications or outcomes ().Dr Craig Miller, reflecting on the development of thoracic endografts, gave part of his presidential address to the American Association for Thoracic Surgery in 2008 and then published an article in theJournal of Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgeryin 2013 on the often overzealous and inappropriate use of thoracic endovascular aneurysm repair.The issue of overuse of some vascular procedures has also been recognized by other specialties who treat vascular disease. A recent study in theJournal of the American College of Cardiologyreported on the shift in lower extremity arterial interventions to the outpatient arena, resulting in an increase in health care costs, primarily due to atherectomy.So, this problem is recognized by those in multiple specialties working in multiple vascular beds\u2014it's not just vascular surgeons who have identified the problem.There have been many memorable SVS presidential addresses, but one that I particularly remember was Dr Norman Hertzer's talk: \u201cOutcome assessment in vascular surgery\u2014results mean everything.\u201dAt the time, very few vascular surgeons had a mechanism to accurately collect data on vascular procedures, and we certainly couldn't benchmark ourselves against colleagues in other parts of the country, but Dr Hertzer convinced the audience that day that we had to track results, no matter how difficult, to become \u201cbetter.\u201d After his address, I returned home and invested great effort into developing a third vascular database, and it failed, as the previous two had, due to the lack of a sustainable infrastructure. So his call to arms\u2014better results through better data\u2014was only occasionally implemented at that time. The next year, SVS president Dr Jerry Goldstone looked at quality in other industries, such as the automotive field, and pointed out both the comprehensive systems used in these industries, as well as the challenges of implementing similar vascular quality programs.Since then, there have been six SVS presidential addresses that discuss quality directly,and virtually all the others discussed quality in a significant part of their talk, and yet we still see quality slipping in some areas of our vascular field\u2014why??The Vascular Quality Initiative (VQI)has\u00a0now\u00a0made it feasible for all of us to assess our outcomes\u2014assuming we have the will, we now have a way. VQI is one of the most visible demonstrations that vascular surgeons, and all others who participate in VQI, are making a quality commitment, using VQI to become \u201cbetter.\u201d Now that we have VQI, we can look more deeply into some of the causes of good and poor quality; however, VQI focuses more on procedural outcomes and less on the appropriateness of the initial decision to treat, so many physicians who do unnecessary or inappropriate procedures can look pretty good, even in VQI! But the issue raised inThe New York Timesarticle: does performing cases in an office-based procedural center lead to inappropriate overtreatment, can now be determined using real-world VQI data.As we know, procedures performed in a physician's office combine the professional and facility fees into one global payment, as seen with venous ablation; for some vascular procedures, such as atherectomy, the total reimbursement can be up to 10 times the professional fee alone (). In the spirit of full disclosure, we have an office-based procedural center at UCLA, and I have observed that both the patients and physicians really value having and doing procedures there, and I also believe that the quality of care in our center is excellent, but because the potential for a very high reimbursement from a procedure in an office-based center can be tempting, we use multiple quality measures () to make sure that our center is used for the patient's benefit, as well as the physician's. In my opinion, any site can deliver appropriate or inappropriate care. The key issue is the lack of mandated quality oversight in office-based centers\u2014that is the problem.Even when a vascular procedure is done in the hospital or a hospital-owned outpatient center, there are many other incentives to overuse procedures, despite the fact that there is less direct financial incentive for the physician. Many community practices, medical schools, and hospitals use relative value units (RVUs) for physician compensation, with RVU incentives designed to drive procedural volume and hospital profit (). It's not that RVUs are inherently bad, because they do measure clinical workload pretty well; however, they do not measure judgment, the appropriateness of decision making, or the quality of outcomes\u2014they are simply a measure of volume, so the more you do, the greater the RVUs. There are also many other motivators pushing vascular specialists to perform procedures in hospital-owned facilities\u2014hospital prestige, access to facilities, and leadership positions are often given to high-volume procedural physicians, and profit is used by many hospitals to pay bonuses to those who run the hospital, so hospital-based procedures are not without the potential for overuse. At many nonprofit academic medical centers, CEOs make in excess of $1.5 million,probably much of it earned for good management, but don't believe for a minute that their salary would be the same if the engine that runs the hospital, big expensive procedures, including vascular procedures, were being done in low volumes, and many for-profit medical centers pay much higher salaries to their leadership.After working at four institutions over my career, I have found that there is no perfect physician or executive compensation system, whether it is straight salary, RVU-based, or collection-based, that fully rewards work effort and contribution, without providing incentives that also reward overtreatment; and incentives that reward volume exist in every part of the health care system (office, outpatient facility, or inpatient facility). With the Affordable Care\u00a0Act mandating accountable care organizations, which attempt to link physicians and hospitals together to control costs, it will be interesting to see the impact on both quality and volume of vascular procedures, as system-wide procedural incentives are reduced.How about competition between specialties\u2014could that be partially responsible for overuse of vascular procedures? Most of us recognize that a patient can come to a major medical center, like UCLA, with a common problem, such as claudication, and receive diametrically opposed opinions regarding the best treatment of the same problem from different specialties. And why is this? Do we evaluate patients differently, obtain different diagnostic tests, or base our recommendations on different literature about the same problem? Unfortunately, the answer to all of these questions is yes, so we should not be surprised that the care of common vascular diseases (as well as practice guidelines written by different specialties) vary when we are trained so differently, evaluate patients differently, and read different literature. To many looking in from the outside, it appears that we are simply\u00a0involved in a battle for control of vascular disease management\u2014a sort of arms race, but using different criteria to treat the same disease process. Shouldn't we all\u00a0(vascular surgeons, interventional radiologists, and interventional cardiologists) be expected, even when competing, to have similar approaches and treatment criteria when performing procedures that cost the health system $20,000 to $50,000 per case? In my opinion, the variation in claudication treatment has gotten so great that all claudicants should walk on a treadmill to document symptoms, to determine the limiting factor that stops the walking, and to record postexercise ankle pressures. And all patients should participate in an exercise program for at least 3 to 4\u00a0months, as well as receive an education packet explaining that they are very unlikely to ever require an amputation. Patients often tell me that they had a procedure for claudication to avoid an amputation. This myth must be eliminated by much better patient education.Because of the loose indications by some physicians when treating patients with claudication, as well as the limited durability of many procedures, there are currently almost as many procedures done on claudicants for failed interventions as initial interventions.As long as treatment failures are common and we have several specialties giving different treatment advice to patients about the same problem, we collectively lose the confidence of our patients. This must change.Part of the explanation for overuse of procedures may also be related to practice philosophy. Gawande, in another article published in 2009 that has been quoted by many concerned with the cost of medical care, compared McAllen, Texas, which had the highest Medicare cost per capita in the U.S. at that time, with El Paso, which is 800 miles north, but with similar demographics. McAllen had much greater use of tests and procedures and double the average cost of care as El Paso.The only explanation that he could find for the difference between the two cities was that many physicians in McAllen owned the diagnostic centers and equipment, while they did not in El Paso. So their practice philosophies were much different. The El Paso doctors saw their role more as traditional physicians, responsible for the overall health of their patients, while the McAllen physicians focused on the business side, maximizing the return on their investment in equipment by performing as many tests and procedures as possible. Gawande recently returned to McAllen, 6\u00a0years later and found a dramatic improvement, particularly among the business-oriented physicians, and the care in the region was also much improved.So, the message seems clear: if we own facilities, we must make sure that the business side of the practice is offset with quality measures, such as VQI, to assure our patients and the public that we are working with their best interest at heart.Could we just be seeing disruptive technology affecting our vascular surgery specialty? Clayton Christensen proposed the concept of \u201cdisruptive innovation\u201d\u2014technology that displaces an established and often good one.What is disturbing about it is that when a company or organization is\u00a0making appropriate, incremental improvements in their existing products, they are the most vulnerable. While they are concentrating on improvement, a new innovation, which is often inferior in quality but also much less expensive, puts the traditional company out of business.In his two presidential addresses, to the Society for Clinical Vascular Surgery and the Pacific Coast Surgical Society, Dr Fred Weaver addressed the issue of \u201cdisruptive technology or disruptive innovation\u201d in surgery.Vascular surgeons have four potential disruptive innovation candidates: (1) endovascular procedures for lower extremity arterial disease, (2) endografts for abdominal and thoracic aneurysms, (3) carotid stents, and (4) endovenous procedures for superficial and deep venous disease. I don't think that the overuse of vascular procedures can be attributed solely to \u201cdisruptive innovation\u201d for several reasons:1.Most of the new technologies, such as venous ablation, provide better outcomes, even initially.2.Many of the new vascular technologies are actually more expensive.3.Vascular surgeons have participated in developing and using the new technologies.Drs Fogarty, Parodi, Greenberg, and Chuter, all vascular surgeons, have represented our specialty very well as device innovators, so we aren't being displaced by technology that has been developed by people outside of our field or profession. A better term in the vascular field might be \u201cexpansive technology.\u201d The problem is that expensive, but minimally invasive, devices have opened up the vascular disease field to physicians who have never been trained in or thought much about vascular disease until they entered practice. A physician with only an MD degree and little or no vascular training can treat vascular disease, often using inappropriate indications and can receive payment for a procedure that previously required 5\u00a0years of general surgery training and 2\u00a0years of specialized vascular training. Some of the procedures, although minimally invasive, can lead to significant long-term misery for the patient when they fail. If you own the site of service, you might make more money in a day, particularly if you do unnecessary procedures, either out of ignorance or greed, than you might make in a week or a month in the field where you trained.Is the problem also a loss of ethics by some physicians? Charles Bosk in his classic book,Forgive and Remember, followed surgeons 24/7 for 1\u00a0year at the University of Chicago and described the unique, uncompromising ethical culture that is instilled during the training of surgeons.He tells of surgical residents who were fired for minimal transgressions, such as reporting a fictitious lab result, even when it had no adverse consequence to the patient. Are there differences in the ethics of physicians who treat vascular disease, based on their training and specialty, or is there a universal loss of ethical standards, which has occurred in our vascular field? Every one of us in this room has told a small white lie to help our patients get something that they need or cannot afford (eg, an indigent patient with a foot wound needs extra dressings or an extra day in the hospital). So what is the difference between modifying the truth slightly with a small white lie to help a patient and saying that a patient has \u201catypical claudication or ischemic rest pain\u201d when he or she actually has arthritis in his or her knee? In one case, the white lie helps that patient; in the other situation, it helps the physician economically but hurts the patient, either medically or financially. What would Charles Bosk say about physicians who perform sometimes risky and always expensive vascular procedures on patients when they knew that they did not need them? He would say that this is unethical behavior\u2014and that we should be fired, just like the resident!John Wooden, who was still attending basketball games when I moved to UCLA 12\u00a0years ago, had many famous quotes\u2014one of the best was, \u201cThe true test of a man's character is what he does when no one is watching.\u201d Doesn't that situation exist in an office-based procedural facility? Currently, no one is watching there! Now, I don't believe that most of us perform inappropriate procedures in office-based facilities, or that those who do inappropriate vascular procedures start out as unethical or immoral people. Medical schools put tremendous effort into selecting not only the brightest and most accomplished students through GPAs and MCAT scores but also by using personal statements and interviews to try to select the most ethical students. So where do some of us go wrong? As Dr Greg Moneta explained to me in response to theNew York Timesarticle, it is a gradual process, supported by a system that primarily rewards the volume of procedures, even accepting some inappropriateness, and those who perform inappropriate procedures rarely start out doing them initially. As Henry Marsh, a British neurosurgeon, writes in his recently published book,Do No Harm, there is an \u201cintense exhilaration\u201d following a successful surgical procedure, like a \u201cconquering general.\u201d It gives \u201ca deep and profound feeling, which I suspect that few people other than surgeons ever get to experience.\u201dSo we are constantly rewarded, not only financially, but also emotionally, for performing procedures\u2014and the great majority of them are indicated, but it is also easy to gradually slip into doing more and more procedures for less and less severe disease. The temptation to overtreat is even greater, the more income that can be made in an unregulated office, eventually leading to too many procedures for too little disease.Dr Ken Murray, a primary care physician who has had many physicians as patients, wrote a fascinating article, \u201cHow Doctors Die\u201d in 2013.He reported that when we physicians develop serious or life-threatening diseases, we often don't accept the same aggressive approach on ourselves as we offer to others, and that the cost of care at the end of life is much lower for physicians who choose the less aggressive path. So, physicians, think about what you would want as treatment for \u201catypical claudication.\u201d Would you want a superficial femoral artery angioplasty or atherectomy to see if it helped? Or would you have an elective repair of an asymptomatic 5-cm AAA when you are 90\u00a0years old? Dr Ken Murray says that most physicians don't want the same aggressive care for themselves that we often recommend to others.What are potential solutions to the dilemma of overtreatment of vascular diseases? First, there is no single, simple solution to this problem\u2014we need a combination of solutions. Here are some related to improving the appropriateness of vascular care that I have thought of\u2014enabling us to do \u201cbetter.\u201d1.Many members of the SVS believe that the site of service is the most important driver in the dramatic increase in inappropriate arterial and venous vascular procedures. Whether or not this is the case, there needs to be an accreditation system that establishes standards for quality in the office, as occurs in the hospital. Accreditation is the first step in preventing abuse by unscrupulous physicians who do unnecessary procedures.2.Reimbursement for vascular care should be linked to board certification and expertise. It still amazes me that physicians with no vascular training can get paid by insurance companies and the federal government for performing vascular procedures. This must stop! In our country, do we want an emergency room physician performing venous ablations or nephrologists doing leg angioplasties or arteriovenous grafts? If vascular disease management is not part of ACGME core training during residency, then it is not appropriate to learn vascular procedures on the job, as patients expect \u201cbetter.\u201d3.CMS has historically opposed financial incentives for participation in outcome registries, but real-world data are critical to developing quality programs and reducing the number of inappropriate vascular procedures. We should ask CMS to provide a bonus to cover the cost of participating in an approved vascular database and fund it by having a comparable penalty for those who do not use one.4.Our health care system should also reimburse for simple low-risk and effective treatments, such as supervised exercise therapy for claudicants and make them mandatory, before authorizing expensive, interventional procedures for claudication. Robert Patterson has written a compelling editorial for theProvidence Journalon this issue, and I recommend it to you.5.We have some vascular procedures with excellent initial short-term success that are not durable. Dr Michael Conte, Dr Frank Pomposelli, and their guidelines writing group, in the recently published SVS practice guidelines on claudication,have proposed a relatively conservative benchmark of a minimum of greater than 50% patency at 2\u00a0years for a device or procedure\u2014and VQI can measure this. If durability of procedures were a criterion for reimbursement, many more patients would be put on exercise therapy for claudication, and many fewer procedures would be performed.6.More extreme solutions include a mandatory second-opinion program for some venous and arterial procedures that have shown massive growth. We know what is appropriate! I've never met a patient who needed four veins ablated at the same sitting or bilateral superficial femoral artery stents in a 95-year-old who has 10-block claudication! These are egregious examples of procedures that none of us would have done on ourselves, and yet every day, patients are talked into these types of procedures. Let's stop this abuse by saying, in a second opinion program, that procedures are not indicated and drive the charlatans out of the field of vascular disease management.7.A second, more Draconian solution is to pay for some elective procedures over time, so that durability is required for complete reimbursement, using the Conte/Pomposelli threshold of 2\u00a0years as a minimum patency for physicians performing claudication treatment to receive full payment.8.We need to work more closely with those who provide coverage decisions about payment for procedures. There was a MEDCAC advisory committee hearing at CMS in 2012 regarding management strategies and reimbursement for carotid stenosis, and another one is scheduled for July of this year regarding peripheral artery disease. But these hearings need to occur earlier, before too many patients have been inappropriately treated. Dr Lowell Kabnick, who is a member of the SVS board and president-elect of the American Venous Forum (AVF), has proposed a\u00a0retreat on reimbursement for venous procedures; getting all parties together to discuss reimbursement is an important step.9.We also need to develop clearly worded consent forms, videos, and educational brochures, as well as provide patients with enough time to read and digest them, before they agree to an elective vascular procedure; every patient needs a truthful interpretation of the literature. Claudicants should not undergo arterial procedures in the belief that they prevent amputation, nor should patients with varicose veins have venous ablations in the belief that they prevent pulmonary emboli.10.I believe that the SVS should participate in three different levels of practice guidelines: single specialty, multispecialty, and international, and that all practice guidelines that we participate in must be evidence-based and free from industry influence. SVS single-specialty guidelinesare much more detailed about the relative roles and technical details of endovascular and open procedures and are relevant primarily to vascular surgeons, while multispecialty guidelinesresolve differences in practice philosophy between specialties. But multispecialty guidelines must have opportunities for minority opinions and not be controlled by virtue of a specialty's size. International practice guidelines have additional value over American guidelines\u2014they recognize that the \u201cworld is flat\u201d and that there are many different and creative approaches to treating vascular disease throughout the world.The current global guidelines for critical limb ischemia, being written by the Global Guidelines Committee, will use the WiFI system,developed by Dr Joseph Mills and coauthors, which was published in theJournal of Vascular Surgery(JVS).These global guidelines demonstrate the critical role that theJVSholds in promoting vascular quality, through publishing original research and reporting standards as well as single-specialty, multispecialty, and international practice guidelines. We need to support both theJVSand\u00a0theJVS Venous and Lymphatic Diseasesjournal to keep quality in vascular disease management at the highest possible level.11.Many in the public still think that vascular surgeons only perform surgery. We are rightly proud of the title \u201cVascular Surgeon,\u201d but, in my opinion, we need to use the term, \u201cVascular Specialist\u201d in the public arena more frequently, to make patients and referring physicians aware of the central role that vascular surgeons play in the wide spectrum of vascular disease management. They need to see our whole persona\u2014as the only specialty that has expertise in all aspects of vascular disease management and the only one where vascular disease is our sole focus. We also need to participate more actively in outpatient vascular centers that focus as much on evaluation, physiologic testing, and risk factor modification, as they do on procedures. Patients need to receive the same attention from us if we recommend that they not have a procedure, as they do if we recommend surgery.We have been fortunate at UCLA to have the Gonda Vascular Center, developed under the leadership of SVS past President Dr Wesley Moore and\u00a0then expanded by past President Dr Julie Freischlag\u2014a single site where all aspects of vascular care can be provided. This center is great for patients and very convenient for our vascular team. It has exam rooms, a vascular lab, wound care, a procedural center, and diabetes management next door\u2014one-stop shopping. It demonstrates to patients our commitment to comprehensive vascular care and the central role that vascular surgeons play in the management of vascular diseases.12.The SVS Clinical Practice Council has been charged with developing \u201cappropriateness guidelines\u201d (similar to \u201cpractice guidelines\u201d) for common vascular procedures. These criteria must include the appropriate site of service (ie, office-based or hospital-based) as well as appropriate indications for procedures. We need them for every common procedure, so all SVS members must use VQI in office-based procedural centers, as well as in the hospital, to provide the data for analysis. Appropriateness guidelines, when developed by the clinical practice council, can then be provided to the governing board\u00a0of the VQI. Was the procedure indicated, was it done in the right practice location, and were the outcomes as expected? Now that the VQI has a director of quality improvement, we must use the VQI to demonstrate that appropriate indications, as well as both short- and long-term outcomes, are the same or better when procedures are done in an office-based center.13.We must develop separate reports for appropriateness and outcomes\u2014the current outcomes report or COPI () should be expanded to provide an additional appropriateness report, because appropriateness in performing a procedure is not the same as reporting outcomes once the procedure has been performed. We must benchmark \u201cappropriate indications\u201d for each vascular surgeon and provide a \u201cCAPI\u201d appropriateness report (), similar to\u00a0the \u201cCOPI\u201d report, to each VQI participant regularly. This report can provide not only a benchmark regarding the appropriateness for the indications for treatment but also opportunities for improvement.14.VQI participants must also do better at collecting long-term data, which measures late procedural failures. Restenosis and endoleaks occur with some arterial procedures, and there are venous procedures that do little to change the natural history of leg edema or venous ulcers. If our quality systems only monitor early results and don't look at late failures, we will do many procedures with the na\u00efve assumption that the long-term results are better than they really are.15.For our society, as Dr Michael Dake, an internationally recognized interventional radiologist, told us at the Crawford symposium last year,the SVS must lead and dedicate itself to using our existing research council committees to conduct research on appropriateness in performing vascular procedures. We are the only society that has the infrastructure, research expertise, and exclusive dedication to the broad field\u00a0of vascular disease management, but we must work with other societies who have legitimate claims to parts of vascular disease management to have credibility and to demonstrate that we speak for the entire field of vascular disease management, not just the SVS.16.The most basic issue related to improving vascular disease management is that some physicians in all specialties who treat vascular disease are doing procedures that they know, in their hearts, are not indicated. The inappropriate procedure rarely causes immediate harm to patients\u2014it comes later when the renal stent restenoses or the distal leg target is lost. There are often great consequences to the patient, but no consequences to the treating physician. In fact, it sometimes gives that same physician another shot at the same procedure. We must recommit ourselves to, as Dr Peter Gloviczki told us 2\u00a0years ago, the \u201cbest vascular care for every patient, every day.\u201d17.Finally, we must adhere to Dr Bob Zwolak's \u201cPrinciples for Vascular Surgeons,\u201d stated several years ago, and modified slightly by me, but as relevant today as it was then:1.Maintain and develop the widest possible expertise, including wound care, dialysis access, amputations, spine exposures, vascular lab, in addition to open and percutaneous vascular treatments. This will make you indispensable.2.Never forget how to perform the highest-quality open vascular surgery\u2014no one else can do that.3.Learn how to be team players and leaders in big medical center environments. And most importantly \u20264.Train and become a vascular surgeon who wants to earn a good wage while being a great doctor, not someone who earns a great wage being a good doctor.Of the suggestions that I have outlined, we, meaning the SVS,JVS, and VQI, have started working on many of them, but we need your help in implementing others.For the past 20\u00a0years, we have told our colleagues in other specialties, as well as our patients, that we are the one specialty who cares for the entire spectrum of vascular disease\u2014we are trained to \u201cdo it all.\u201d But we now need to use this broad expertise to also become role models for providing the most \u201cappropriate treatment.\u201d We need to offer our patients the same advice and treatment that we would give to our brother or sister, or mother or father. We need to \u201ctake that high road\u201d and always recommend the most appropriate treatment, whether it be medical therapy, open surgery, or endovascular therapy, to become \u201cbetter.\u201d",
  "2016": "Thank you, Ron, for that very gracious introduction. Good morning! As I stand before you this morning, I'm reminded of another experience on a very special morning, 3\u00a0years ago\u2014August, 2013, on the campus of Yale University. We had just helped our daughter, Rachel, move into her freshman dorm room and were walking across campus to go to lunch. I think we went to Claire's\u2014a great vegetarian restaurant in New Haven. I can't believe I just said great, and vegetarian, in the same sentence\u2014Rachel, I've come so far!As we were making our way across campus, filled with excited incoming freshman and their proud parents, I noticed a couple tears on the side of my daughter's face. I stopped and asked \u201cRachel, what's wrong? What's the matter?\u201d She looked at me with those beautiful blue eyes, took a couple breaths, and said \u201cDaddy\u2014I can't believe I'm here! I just can't believe I'm here.\u201dNow, I understood immediately what she was thinking. Several months after her notification, she was still amazed that she had been accepted to attend one of the great academic institutions in the world, although in my completely objective opinion, her grade point average over her first 3\u00a0years indicates that the Admissions Committee exactly knew what they were doing!But, while I understood what she was thinking, I don't believe that I truly felt the emotions that were coursing through her veins that morning myself, until this morning. Because\u2014I can't believe I'm here! I truly cannot believe, now even at the end of my term, that I'm standing before you, as the President of the Society for Vascular Surgery (SVS). There's no better reward in any profession than to be respected and honored by one's peers. And, when I think about the long list of true icons of our specialty who have served in this role and inspired so many of us over the years (); when I consider all the dedicated contemporary leaders of our specialty, who are working so hard today in the interests of our members, and who are truly deserving of this position; for this retired taxi driver to be singled out to serve as your president, is unbelievably humbling\u2014and I thank you so much for this, the greatest honor of my professional life.My path to this podium has been long and not without a few bumps along the way. It began nearly 35\u00a0years ago in another New England town, Boston, Massachusetts, where as a fellow I attended my first SVS meeting, and I still have my program book from 1982 (). I actually presented a paper at that meeting, entitled \u201cVascular Complications of Intra-Aortic Balloon Counterpulsation: Implications for Prevention and Management.\u201d We subsequently published the paper in theArchives of Surgery,before theJournal of Vascular Surgerywas founded: my very first publication.The intra-aortic balloon pump had been introduced into clinical practice in the 1960s and was widely used during my residency in the 1970s. It was a truly remarkable and, at times, life-saving technology for untold numbers of patients for whom there were few, or no, other therapeutic options left to support their failing hearts. But, the balloon pump was not without significant risks, including major vascular complications like ischemic limbs and amputations, aortic dissections, mesenteric infarction, and vascular death. In our series of roughly 800 cases, the largest reported series at the time, the complication rate was 11%, and I presented and wrote about the overall risks quite candidly.How incredibly ironic it is, never in a million years, as I was writing, and presenting that paper, could I have ever imagined that 25\u00a0years later, I myself would be critically ill and my life would be supported by an intra-aortic balloon pump for nearly a week in my hospital\u2014in the Coronary Care Unit in cardiogenic shock due to biventricular failure, and for several days in the cardiac surgery intensive care unit after emergency open heart surgery. That very device I wrote about somewhat critically, now supporting me. And yet, nearly a decade later, I'm healthy enough to go out at night and play cowboys with past SVS Presidents (,a)\u2026 and appear with a singing cowboy (,b)\u2026 and stand before you today as your president.My friends, I don't think you can truly understand how\u00a0absolutely blessed I feel to have been able to serve\u00a0as your president this year and to speak to you this morning.What an incredible cardiovascular health care system we are all part of that saves lives and limbs every day of the week, every week of the year, in our hospitals in this country and in much of the world!And, how truly blessed each and every one of you is to be part of that health care system and to have the privilege\u2014and make no mistake about it, it is a distinct privilege\u2014to be able to come to work every day as vascular nurses, physicians assistants (PAs), sonographers, and as vascular surgeons and care for your patients.I would not be standing here today without the support, friendship, mentoring, and confidence of many individuals, wonderful role models, far too numerous to mention, but a few I must.Although it may seem backwards, two of the most important role models in my life in recent years are my two children: Rachel and Mason. I don't know of many other individuals who are more moral, more decent, and more pure of character in how they conduct their lives. Growing up, they never gave us a moment of trouble (as long as I ignore the motor vehicle \u201csituations\u201d). They embody character traits that I emulate but at times have fallen short as a person to achieve. And, they would not have become the outstanding young woman and man they are if they had not been raised, almost single-handedly, by my bride, Patti, because I was often a distracted, and at times almost an absentee, father. Patti is one of the most dedicated moms and caring people I know, while I am an imperfect soul. I only hope you all understand that I was trying to do some good, and you know how much I love you, always have, and always will, and I'm so glad we're together this morning.Among our specialty's leaders, there is no more important role model, for any of us, than my friend Dr\u00a0Ali AbuRahma. An international medical graduate born in Jordan and educated in Egypt, Ali epitomizes the American dream. He came to this country to seek the best training and built one of the largest, most productive and respected multispecialty vascular groups in the country; he's been a prolific clinical researcher and contributor to our literature; and a leader in intersocietal vascular laboratory governance; while at the same time, he's embodied what a loving father and husband should be. Ali is one of the most unassuming, kind, and considerate people I know. At times, I think he's enjoyed my successes more than I did. He's been more than my friend; he's been the brother I never had. He does what he does for others not because he wants something; he does it because he cares about people, and he understands what is truly important in life. He epitomizes the very best of who we are as a specialty, and a society.The SVS has been led by so many truly incredible presidents but none more influential than our 50th President, Dr Frank Veith. It was Frank Veith who taught us decades ago that you don't have to amputate a leg if the disease process extends beyond the knee, and literally thousands of patients in this country, and around the world, have had their limbs salvaged by his skills or his teaching. It was Frank Veith who told us that if we don't evolve and accept endovascular therapy, our specialty would become extinct, and we followed his lead and not only accepted endovascular therapy but became leaders in the field. It was Frank Veith who embraced endovascular aneurysm repair when many summarily dismissed this novel concept. And, it was Frank Veith who fought tirelessly to establish vascular surgery as the independent specialty we are today, with our own Vascular Surgery Board, supported by an incredible Associate Executive Director, Dr Robert Rhodes.But, none of that is really all that important or why I mention Frank Veith this morning. I want to tell you a very personal story about Frank that none of you know. I've never shared this story with anyone, but you need to hear this because it tells you about a different side of Frank and, much more important, about our specialty and this society.When I came home from the hospital after my bout with the health care system, I was pretty beat up. Among other things I was trying to get over a postoperative pneumonia; they gave me this incentive spirometer to work on. I could barely blow 150\u00a0mL. I spent many days lying on my back on the sofa, staring at the ceiling and wondering if tomorrow would be better, or, at times, wondering whether there would even be a tomorrow. It was a Saturday afternoon on a holiday weekend, Labor Day weekend, and the phone rang and my wife picked it up. After a few words, she brought me the phone, put her hand on the receiver, and said, \u201cIt's Dr Veith, he says he needs to talk to you right away, and he says it's very, very important.\u201d Now, I know there are many of Dr Veith's former fellows in the room this morning, and you all know exactly what my reaction was to: \u201cIt's Dr Veith, and he needs to talk to you right away; it's very important.\u201d I immediately broke into a cold sweat! The good news is that this time, it wasn't my heart. The bad news is that it was Dr Veith, and I began to try to figure out what in the world I possibly could have done to upset Dr Veith. I mean, I had just been in the hospital for 2\u00a0weeks, critically ill, most of it intubated on a ventilator: I couldn't talk. And, as I'm ruminating over this, my wife asks: \u201cAre you going to talk to him or not?\u201d So, I reluctantly took the phone and we exchanged pleasantries, and before I knew what hit me, he launched into a pep talk; an amazingly uplifting and passionate pep talk, about me and my future\u2014a pep talk that would have made Knute Rockne proud. He didn't miss a beat. He talked about it all\u2014my surgical life, my academic life, my personal life, my political life; he even talked about my future sex life, Frank Veith, and it was all incredibly positive! And, you know what, he was right\u2014about almost all of it. He was a little off\u2014on the political life\u2014but even that worked out. Now, I don't know if Frank will remember that call that holiday weekend, or the details of it, but I can tell you I have never forgotten it, and I never will! He made that call not because he wanted something; he called because he cares. He cares about his colleagues the way he cares about patients, the way he cares deeply about our specialty. We are vascular surgeons. We care!I want to fast forward to our 64th President, Dr Anton, \u201cTony,\u201d Sidawy. What I learned from Tony's SVS presidency is that you can lead with a quiet voice, by the clarity of your thoughts and your wisdom, and by the example you set. Tony has been my partner for many years. We've worked on various projects over the years but none more important, or gratifying, than for the last nearly 8\u00a0years as Editors of theJournal of Vascular Surgery,and now the threeJournal of Vascular Surgerypublications, one of the great professional joys of my life. Although we didn't always agree on everything, we have never been disagreeable\u2014not for one moment. Tony has been my friend, my confidant, my adviser, my other brother from whom I could always expect wise counsel. He was always there for me not because I could do something for him; he was there because he cares. He cares about his colleagues the way he cares about his patients, the way he cares about our specialty and this society. We are vascular surgeons and we care.We are a teamBut, we are so much more than vascular surgeons. Our specialty is an inclusive vascular surgical family\u2014a vascular surgery team!We're also the registered nurse (RN) who stays for 2\u00a0hours after her busy shift is over in the room of an elderly man who underwent a below-the-knee amputation that morning because of the ravages of diabetes mellitus, and because he has no one else to be with him, and she knows how afraid and upset he is and unsure about his future. So, she stays and talks to him, and holds his hand, and reassures him that he will recover and get better, while her family is home waiting for a dinner that will be late that night. You all know her\u2014or him\u2014or nurses like her in your hospitals. She does what she does not because it's her job\u2014her shift is long over; she does it because she cares about her patients, as we all do. We are a vascular surgery family. We care. That is what we do!We're also the vascular PA who volunteered to serve in the role of clinical research coordinator for a multicenter, randomized trial of an angiogenesis factor, and because we had no one else to fill that role and otherwise therefore could not participate. This is not her job. She really had no time to do it, and she knew she wouldn't be paid for it. But, she volunteered nevertheless because she knew that it was an important study that might help us down the line save the limbs of a few more patients! So, she followed the study patients and filled out the study books, often at night and on her weekends, and even tended to the study when off on her own maternity leave! That PA works on my team. She's in this room this morning. You all know her\u2014or him\u2014or PAs or nurse practitioners (NPs) like her on your teams. She does what she does not because it's necessarily in her job description; she does it because she cares deeply about what we all do as vascular surgeons. We are a vascular surgery family and we care. That is who we are!We're also the vascular lab sonographer who faces yet another day with an overbooked schedule. But, on this day, she finishes a carotid duplex on an elderly lady at noon, and it looks like she may actually be able to leave the lab for lunch. But, she can see that this patient is upset and fearful that she's going to have a stroke, and she won't be seeing the vascular surgeon for another couple hours. So, instead of going to lunch, she stays in the lab and talks to this patient and shows her the images of her study, image after image, and explains to her that it all looks really good, and she feels confident that the vascular surgeon will tell her the same thing. This isn't in her job description. She spends this time with this patient because she cares. This sonographer works in my lab and makes me so proud to come to work every day. You all know her\u2014or him\u2014or sonographers like her in your labs. She epitomizes our vascular surgical family. We care. That is our culture!Vascular surgery exceptionalism: our brandIn his recent New York Times bestseller,The Road to Character,David Brooks introduces the concept of resume virtues, as opposed to eulogy virtues. Resume virtues naturally encompass what's on one's resume or CV. Resume virtues document one's tangible, measurable accomplishments and career and professional successes and outline what contributes to our external success. In our surgical world, our resume virtues are defined, in part, by how many cases one has performed, how profitable one's practice has been, how many papers one has published, how many committees one sits on in the hospital or in professional societies, how many impressive titles one has achieved.On the other hand, David Brooks tells us that eulogy virtues encompass the much deeper measures of the individual's being\u2014our character, our commitment, the intangible measures of our goodness. External success is achieved through competition with others. But, character is built during the confrontation with one's own weaknesses. It is our character that defines our dedication to our patients and drives us to carry out the appropriate care for our patients, that our President talked about during his address last year.InThe Lonely Man of Faith,published in 1965, Rabbi Joseph Soloveitchik discusses the two accounts of creation in Genesis, representing opposing sides of our nature, which he called Adam I and Adam II. Adam I is the resume Adam who builds, creates, and produces. Adam II is the internal Adam who strives to embody moral values. Adam I wants to conquer the world, while Adam II wants to serve the world. We are Adam II!I truly respect the knowledge and clinical expertise and dedication of, and value my partnership with, my cardiology and radiology colleagues in my institution, and nationally through the collaboration of our respective Societies on important initiatives of mutual interest. But, while I mean no professional disrespect, I also sincerely believe invascular surgery exceptionalism. Not\u00a0that we're better\u2014we're not\u2014but simply that vascular surgeons areuniquein the management of patients with circulatory disease. We are unique because we are\u00a0exclusively devoted, 100% of our specialty, to the management of patients with vascular disease. It's estimated that about 30% of radiology practice, and 10% of cardiology practice today, is devoted to the care of vascular patients.We are unique in the field of circulatory disease because we're the only vascular specialists who offer the\u00a0entire spectrum of treatment options\u2014medical, endovascular, and open surgery\u2014as the condition warrants, and therefore are best equipped to judge appropriate care. And, it was vascular surgeons who pioneered the development of noninvasive vascular diagnostic techniques so critical to the evaluation of vascular patients, and we continue to lead in the field today. But also, we don't treat lesions! We take care of patients, and we follow our patients long term, and we get to know our patients, as people, and we dedicate ourselves to optimizing our patients' vascular health.This is our brand!We don't fix aneurysms. That's not what we do. We take care of the 72-year-old grandmother with a 6-cm aortic aneurysm so that she will live to attend her grandson's college graduation in 2\u00a0years, and she will gratefully recount the joy of that day to her vascular surgeon on her first annual follow-up visit after the graduation.We don't open blocked leg arteries. That's not our job. We salvage the limb of the 58-year-old diabetic father with an ischemic ulcer and rest pain so that he will be able to walk down the aisle with his only daughter on her wedding day in just 6\u00a0weeks, and who will emotionally thank his vascular surgeon on his first visit after the wedding.We don't publish Clinical Practice Guidelines and produce VESAP [Vascular Education and Self-Assessment Program] and other educational products to satisfy our resume-oriented virtues. We produce these works to help improve the care of patients in this country and all over the world; patients whom we don't know, and will never touch, but for whom optimizing their vascular health is our mission, and the reason for this society to exist. We do this because we care.You should all be so proud as SVS members to see this email we received from Dr David Linyama, a general surgeon performing vascular surgery in Zambia, in southern Africa, thanking our membership for donating VESAP to him, as we have to other surgeons in disadvantaged countries around the world (). This is what your society does. We are a society of Adam IIs, because we serve and we care.This is our brand!Vascular surgery leadershipInThe Greatest Generation,Tom Brokaw celebrates our World War II generation's character and strength in most difficult times. He specifically cites traits of personal responsibility and duty, which contributed to building the American economy and making major advances in\u00a0science.The health of Brokaw's Greatest Generation has tremendously benefitted from the contributions of our SVS Greatest Generation, the pioneering leaders in vascular surgery, giants like Jack Wylie, Robert Linton, and Gene Strandness; Jesse Thompson, Allan Callow, and Wiley Barker, and so many more, who elucidated the natural history of vascular disease, and developed techniques we continue to refine today to treat that disease process, and whose contributions were described in Andrew Dales'Band of Brothers, and are so poignantly captured in our video history project led by Jimmy Yao and now Walter McCarthy.Their contributions set the foundation for the historic reductions in the rate of limb amputations from advanced ischemia; substantial reductions in stroke mortality and morbidity due to carotid disease; and dramatically reduced mortality through the early detection and now innovative repair of aortic aneurysms that vascular surgeons are achieving for our patients in contemporary practice.Our pioneers entrusted us with this incredible specialty of vascular surgery, and this society. Thirteen years ago, Presidents Jack Cronenwett and Tom Riles lead the merger of our two national vascular surgical societies, the American Association for Vascular Surgery (AAVS) and the SVS, into the contemporary SVS.Although we've maintained the name Society for Vascular Surgery, we are a completely new, more inclusive and more comprehensive, and, in my opinion, much better organization today. Although the SVS was historically an academic society that produced a world class annual educational meeting and supported research, this is now only a fraction of what we do today. We are no longer your father's SVS!Since the merger, our membership has more than doubled, to >5400, including our podiatry partners, cardiologists, radiologists, and other allied health specialists such as PAs and nurses, and >700 international members and 10 international chapters. We are a vascular surgery family!I've had the honor this year of working with an incredible leadership team: Ron Fairman, Clem Darling, Michel Makaroun, and Kim Hodgson, who've helped me oversee an organizational governance structure of four councils, 28 committees with >400 volunteer members, and a board of directors of 25 dedicated leaders serving the interests of our members and our patients.Our work has been supported by an extraordinary team of professionals in our Chicago and Washington, D.C. offices, led by our Executive Director, Rebecca Maron. Becky has served in that role since the merger. She's been a partner, sage adviser, and friend to me and all 13 presidents since the merger. We would not be the successful organization we have become without her brilliant leadership and professionalism. I know I speak for all of us who have been graced by her friendship and support in wishing her all the best in her retirement.For any organization, or specialty, to be successful, one must understand, and honestly accept, one's identity: its strengths and, more important, its limitations. It's therefore vitally important for us as a specialty to understand what we are to strategize effectively. And what we are is a very, very tiny specialty, really a speck in the health care universe. In fact, vascular surgery is the smallest of the 36 major specialties recognized by the Association of American Medical Colleges. There are a little more than 3000 vascular surgeons and more than 27,000 cardiologists in the United States today. There are 31,000 members of the American Heart Association and 47,000 members of the American College of Cardiology.But, although we will never have their numbers, we have somethingunique. We have our vascular surgical culture; ourbrand. But, for us to be heard, for vascular surgeons to leverage our brand and compete successfully in this complex health care system as the minority specialty we are, vascular surgery must speak withone voice, one unified voice, and the SVS provides that voice which speaks for vascular surgeons,allvascular surgeons, 52\u00a0weeks of the year!We are oneThe majority of vascular surgical care in this country today is delivered in the community by private practice vascular surgeons. Two-thirds of our members are community practitioners. Dozens of community practitioners serve on and are positively contributing to our most important committees. Private practitioners are leaders in this organization. Our current President-Elect, Ron Fairman, spent 7\u00a0years in solo private practice. Our current Vice President, Clem Darling, is in private practice. We understand the challenges facing community practitioners. We are one!We established a Community Practice Committee to represent the interests of that constituency, and the importance of that committee is reflected in the fact that its chair now has a seat on our Board of Directors, a position now held by Dr Richard Lynn, to whom I am most grateful for his enthusiastic and thoughtful leadership. The chair of no other independent committee, other than the Program Committee, has a seat on the Board of Directors, where society decisions are made. This year, despite a tight budget, we appropriated $100,000 to fund a community practice strategic plan! That is how important community practitioners are in this Society and our specialty. No\u2014this is not your father's SVS! We are one!We lost a member and, much more important, a dear friend, and an incredibly brilliant innovator in our specialty, Roy Greenberg, a little more than 2\u00a0years ago to illness. We miss Roy so much. Roy once said he wanted his children, \u201cto know the world is a small place, with friends everywhere they go.\u201dIn that spirit, I see our small specialty, and this society, as a small world of dedicated professionals: community and academic practitioners, clinicians and researchers, women and men, young and old, physicians and allied health care professionals, who know and respect each other, and who share common goals and challenges, and work together in a spirit of cooperation, to advance our specialty and the needs of our patients. That is our culture!In fact, it's clear that today in our dramatically evolving health care system, the lines of demarcation between community and academic practice are rapidly blurring, if not completely dissolving. In our academic centers, the focus on scholarship\u2014research and teaching, regrettably, is being supplanted at times by greater emphasis on financial productivity: relative value units (RVUs) rather than publications.Furthermore, surgeons in solo and small group practices are closing their independent practices, and becoming full-time employees of hospitals or health care systems at a very rapid rate, and are facing many of the same challenges and pressures as full-time academic surgeons. Between 2005 and 2013, 71,000 physicians left independent practice for hospital employment. Currently, about 60% of physicians, and about two-thirds of surgeons, are hospital employees.It's estimated that another 27,000 physicians will become hospital employees this year.Our SVS members who are maintaining their independent private practices need support to deal with changing reimbursement models, satisfying quality outcome measures, MACRA, and MIPS, and other seemingly endless regulatory burdens. It's the administration's goal that this year 30% of Medicare fee-for-service payments will flow through alternate payment models, such as bundled payments, and 50% by 2018, while we move to a system where reimbursement will depend on achieving quality measures rather than for clinical volumes. The SVS is devoting the resources and strategic focus through our full-time Washington, D.C. office in working with CMS [the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services] and key Congressional leadership to represent your interests, to develop appropriate and achievable quality measures and reasonable bundled payment models to support your practices, and to allow you to succeed in this new world order.SVS leadershipAnd, as the very small specialty we are, as Helen Keller once said: \u201cAlone we can do so little. Together we can do so much!\u201dAnd, so much we have already accomplished!In light of our small numbers and limited resources compared to other professional societies, our recent accomplishments are truly remarkable! For example, despite enormous pressure for health care cost containment and reductions in reimbursement, the SVS recently secured an increase in reimbursement for EVAR [endovascular aneurysm repair]. And, by the way, in case you didn't notice, we also secured an increase in RVUs for carotid endarterectomy.At a time of unprecedented focus on health care quality, the SVS, our small organization, representing our tiny specialty, is theleaderin promoting quality improvement for patients with circulatory disease! Our VQI [Vascular Quality Initiative] is now certified as a Qualified Clinical Data Registry for meaningful use. In fact, under the visionary leadership of Jack Cronenwett and others, the SVS is the first medical Society to have a government-certified Patient Safety Organization (PSO)! Our PSO and VQI leadership is now collaborating with the FDA [Food and Drug Administration], and several device manufacturers, to capture postmarket surveillance data, and we're tracking the outcomes of vena cava filters, and novel endovascular devices, in the spirit of our shared commitment to optimizing patient care, and our influence is only going to grow!We do far more than produce this annual world class educational meeting and support groundbreaking research. The SVS is working every day on behalf of our members. This year our Government Relations Advocacy was crucial in the repeal of the Sustainable Growth Rate formula. We're now collaborating with the American College of Surgeons to develop episode-based alternative payment models, now targeting our highest volume procedures including carotid endarterectomy, EVAR, endovascular leg revascularization, and arteriovenous fistula. Weleda coalition this year to defeat legislation that would have capped nonfacility payment to ambulatory surgery centers and hospital-outpatient centers. This year weleda coalition to block legislation that would have eliminated the 10-day and 90-day global surgical packages. And, havingleda coalition that established the SAAVE Act [Screening Abdominal Aortic Aneurysms Very Efficiently] for aneurysm screening, this year we convinced congress to eliminate the 1-year time limit for referral, and we achieved a higher payment level for abdominal aortic aneurysm screening. Together, we have done so much, and we have only just begun!Protecting our patients' careBut, as President Kennedy once said, \u201cfor of those to whom much is given, much is required.\u201dI would argue that it is now our time, and our responsibility, to build on what was given to us by our pioneering founders, to continue to not only advance the science of vascular surgery, and to support our practitioners, but equally importantly, to assume the moral responsibility of protecting the care of our patients, the Greatest Generation, at a time when I fear that their care is seriously threatened.The Greatest Generation deserves our respect, our gratitude, and the highest quality health care. We're privileged to have the opportunity to care for them, and in our rapidly changing health care system in this country, with real financial threats to Medicare, it must be our mission to not only care for them, but in fact our duty to ensure their access to that care!I'm concerned about our patients' access to care in the future due to a shortage of skilled practitioners. With increasing numbers of insured individuals as a result of the Affordable Care Act, there's a projected shortage of 91,000 physicians by 2020, and 130,000 by 2025.In fact, although many public health policy experts pontificate about the excesses of the American health care system, the number of practicing physicians in the United States today pales in comparison with other developed countries.This shortage of practitioners may also be exacerbated by the graying of our workforce and accelerated retirement, both voluntary and involuntary retirement, of our surgical workforce. Currently, 40% of practicing physicians in the United States are over the age of 55. The number of practicing physicians older than 65 has quadrupled since 1975. Today, approximately 26% of the physicians practicing in America, roughly 240,000, are over the age of 60. There are at least 20,000 over the age of 70.These numbers parallel our specialty. More than a quarter of SVS members, 27%, are over the age of\u00a060.Owing to increasing regulatory burdens, growing overhead costs, and reduced reimbursement, the voluntary retirement age for physicians in general, and more so for surgeons, has declined dramatically over the last decade. In a recent survey of 20,000 physicians conducted by the Physician's Foundation, it was noted that 39% planned to accelerate their retirement owing to recent changes in our health care system.Potentially deepening this manpower shortage is the issue of involuntary retirement. No one can deny that surgical performance is dependent upon technical skill and dexterity, and cognitive function and memory, which all may be adversely impacted by advancing age. The AMA [American Medical Association] through its Council on Medical Education claims that \u201cpast the age of 60 there are differences in performance that may become apparent.\u201dSome public health leaders argue that physicians, and especially surgeons, should be treated in the same fashion as other professionals entrusted with the public safety. Just as pilots, and air traffic controllers, and others are subject to a mandatory retirement age, they argue that similar arbitrary limits should be placed on our profession. And, in several countries, a mandatory physician retirement age has been implemented ().Institutions in this country are responding by introducing mandatory health screening processes for older practitioners. For example, Stanford requires physicians over the age of 75 to undergo mandatory physical exams; and at the University of Virginia, physicians over the age of 70 must undergo physical and cognitive screening tests.However, the evidence indicates that not everyone ages in the same fashion and in fact many older physicians and surgeons function with superb clinical and technical skills and should continue to practice. For example, in a published study reporting comprehensive neuropsychological testing of surgeons and aged-matched controls, surgeons at all ages performed better than nonsurgical control groups, suggesting that functional standards applied to the population as a whole may not be predictive among surgical specialists.We must be vigilant in making certain that public policy is evidence based. For example, in a study including >460,000 Medicare patients undergoing eight surgical operations, it was reported that operative mortality was significantly higher when carotid endarterectomy was performed by surgeons over the age of 60.However, this difference was limited to surgeons over the age of 60 with low-volume carotid practices, a not unexpected finding. The oldest surgeons with high-volume, or even medium-volume, practices had comparable outcomes as younger operators.As pointed out in a recentJAMAeditorial, there's a need to develop national standards to assess physician competency, and such standards should be specialty specific.I believe that the SVS, working together with regulatory bodies such as the Vascular Surgery Board, should play a leadership role in developing such competency standards to not only protect our patients but at the same time to protect the rights of our members before they are imposed on us by outside authorities.Our physician shortage may also be exacerbated by an inadequate number of training positions. Since Medicare funding for residency training was capped by Congress in 1997, there's been little increase in new residency positions, although our population has grown by 50 million people.Unfortunately, many health policy experts, and some political leaders, believe that we're facing a significant shortage only of primary care physicians. However, although the Association of American Medical Colleges notes that we will need approximately 45,000 additional primary care physicians by 2020, that same analysis indicates we will also need 46,000 additional surgeons and medical specialists.And, although some have suggested that we can utilize nurses and other allied health professionals to compensate for these physician shortages, in fact we're facing an even greater shortage of nurses and PAs in the near future. Of the 3 million nurses practicing in the United States today, 1 million are over the age of 50; that is, one-third of our nurses will retire within the next 10 to 15\u00a0years, and we don't have enough schools and nursing faculty to train their replacements.Using either a population-based analysis or a workload model, a recent study indicates that there is already a shortage of vascular surgeons in this country today, and that shortage will only deepen in the future with the aging of our population and our surgical workforce.Although this research was conducted by vascular surgeons and published in theJVS, it's been confirmed by other independent analyses. For example, in a study published inHealth Affairs, a public health journal, it was estimated that vascular surgery has thehighest demand growthof any specialty over the next decade, more than cardiology, and clearly more than\u00a0primary care services.Specifically, this analysis projected a 31% increase in the demand for vascular surgeons and only a 14% increased demand for primary care physicians.In the United States today, there are about 120,000 people for each vascular surgeon and in fact more people per vascular surgeon than per primary care physicians, or any other specialty!We all know how busy we are, and how hard we work, to deliver care to our patients. Now, that workload has been confirmed. Using family practitioners as the baseline, vascular surgeons on average work more hours than any other major medical specialty.We need to train more vascular surgeons!The SVS has taken very seriously the responsibility of mentoring medical students and residents to stimulate their interest in vascular surgery. In collaboration with our industry partners, we've collectively invested hundreds of thousands of dollars over the last several years to provide scholarships and programming for students and residents at our annual meeting and have realized a substantial return on that investment, with nearly 40% of the attendees entering a vascular surgery training program. And, vascular surgery, as the independent specialty we are, with our own Vascular Surgery Board, has pioneered early differentiation training pathways that our young people want and other specialties are now following our lead!Although we must continue to mentor, I would argue that the impending shortage of vascular surgeons is not just a vascular surgery problem, nor is it a surgery problem in general. I believe that this is truly a public health problem, and a political problem, and must be addressed as such. In my opinion, there is no more innovative or intellectually and emotionally satisfying surgical specialty today than vascular surgery. There has never been a better time to be a vascular surgeon\u2014andour best days as a specialty are ahead of us!However, we should not idly sit back and allow our services to be undervalued or our altruism to be taken for granted, nor should we, or our patients, be disproportionately penalized owing to the financial challenges to Medicare, which may adversely impact our ability to attract the best and brightest students, who carry enormous educational financial debt, into our specialty if our eulogy values are not matched by appropriate compensation.We understand that the financial challenges to Medicare are severe. Over the last three decades, Medicare spending has grown in excess of premium payments, and that gap has widened over the last 15\u00a0years.Each day in this country, an additional 10,000 senior citizens enroll in the Medicare system, what Forbes magazine calls a \u201csilver tsunami.\u201dAs a result, a major goal of the Affordable Care Act is to reduce the rate of growth of Medicare spending; that is, to \u201cbend\u201d the spending curve.Among the major surgical specialties, vascular surgery is second only to ophthalmology in annual Medicare spending, and if drug costs are not considered, vascular surgery would be number one!We're in the CMS bull's eye and it's likely that we may be disproportionately impacted by future cuts mandated by the Independent Payment Advisory Board. We've already seen the leading edge of this process. For example, from 2010 through 2013, bundling of codes resulted in a 27% reduction in RVUs, and thus reimbursement, for peripheral vascular interventions.The need to control health care spending is undeniable. But, in fact, 20% to 30% of American health care expenditures today are consumed by administrative costs, more than double any other industrialized country and nearly three times greater than many.In fact, physician compensation accounts for\u00a0<20% of overall health care expenditures, although physicians control approximately 80% of all health care spending.Although the need to control spending has focused on practitioners, and especially so-called highly paid specialists, in fact, the highest paid professionals in the U.S. health care system are not physicians! They are hospital executives and administrators and insurance company executives. And, they're being paid more today than ever before and more than in any other country!For example, in a 2012 survey of 147 not-for-profit hospital chief executive officers (CEOs), the average annual compensation was $2 million. And, while physicians have seen our compensation remain relatively flat in recent years, a high percentage of our health care executives have realized significant increases in compensation during these difficult economic times, including one-third who received a 10% or greater increase and 14% who received a 50% or greater increase in compensation.It's said that these levels of compensation are justified by the complexity of the job, and clearly running a hospital, or a multihospital health care system, is extremely demanding. But, the office of the President of the United States, a pretty demanding responsibility, pays $400,000 annually.I know of no other field where there is such income inequality between those who provide the product, in this case health care, and their so called \u201cmanagers.\u201d As talented a CEO, and decent a person, as Dr Torchiana is, I doubt that very many patients come to my alma mater, the Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH), because he is CEO. They come for the state of the art care delivered by the MGH doctors and nurses\u2014like their world class vascular surgeons, our past SVS president Dr\u00a0Richard Cambria and his partners, as they do in all of our hospitals. Health care executives deserve to be compensated fairly for their talents, but our care should not be undervalued!And, although our numbers are small, vascular surgery is a key player in health care system economics. Over the next 5\u00a0years, heart and vascular care is projected to be one of the most important service lines driving hospital volumes.Vascular surgical care specifically will be one of the most significant contributors to hospital margins.Furthermore, in our new value-based health care system, physician leadership is going to be increasingly important, really critical, for hospitals to achieve their financial targets, which will be directly linked to achieving quality outcomes, rather than case volumes, as was the model historically.The SVS record of leadership in publishing clinical practice guidelines, and defining appropriate care, and in promoting quality care will afford our members the credibility and the respect of the administrators in their institutions and will give vascular surgeons a strategic advantage in competing with the part-time vascular practitioners in other specialties, despite our minority status. Vascular surgical leadership will be crucial to the success of heart and vascular centers. Our hospitals need us!In fact, it was Albert Einstein who said that \u201cin the middle of difficulty lies opportunity.\u201dTherefore, I'm absolutely convinced that the current changes in our health care system, the focus on quality outcomes, represents a moment of unprecedentedopportunityfor us to finally demonstrate to the stakeholders, the payors and our hospital administrators, and the public the distinctive competencies, anduniqueexpertise, and value of vascular surgeons,vascular surgical exceptionalism, and what differentiates us from the competition. Despite our small numbers, we can compete successfully with other specialties, and we will. This is our time!This year as president I made it my highest priority to devote the financial and human resources necessary to develop a comprehensive SVS public relations infrastructure to communicate our brand to the key stakeholders: hospital and health care system administrators, payors, the media, and the public. We've begun with a complete remake of our website, with voluminous new patient-oriented educational material. Seventy percent of our website traffic comes from the public seeking medical information. We're cultivating key contacts in the media so when a story about vascular disease of public interest emerges, SVS members will be their primary contact! And, we're recruiting an SVS member rapid response team of experts at the national and local levels to be available in real time for news interviews as stories break. But, we'll also be proactive in distributing press releases on a regular basis to the media, and we're going to partner with major national newswires to distribute content to >200,000 media points and 10,000 websites. We also need to educate the stakeholders about appropriate care by publishing our clinical practice guidelines in laymen's terms in health care industry trade publications and not just theJVS. No, this is not your father's SVS! And, we have just begun!But, although the SVS is going to be your indispensable ally in succeeding in this new world order of quality-based outcomes and reimbursement, I believe each of us must also assume individual responsibility in protecting our specialty; that is, we must become political activists at the grassroots level.Specifically, I believe that a key strategy moving forward is to directly partner politically with our patients. Senior citizens clearly understand that our manpower shortages, and reductions in reimbursement, and the financial challenges faced by our Medicare system directly threaten their access to care.In fact, in a recent survey of AARP [American Association of Retired Persons] members, the viability of Medicare was their number one concern!This represents opportunity! We have a tremendous opportunity to impact on our political system, not just collectively through our Washington, D.C. office and our PAC, butindividuallyat the grassroots level by aligning and partnering with our patients in this political process. Senior citizens are the most dependable voting bloc in the American electoral system, and it is predicted that demographic group will dominate future elections. Each of us has direct access to that powerful voting bloc\u2014senior citizens\u2014our patients.Every day in our offices, our clinics, and on the wards, we need to communicate with our patients about health care policy. They respect us, they listen to us, and they understand the issues, and they know we care! The message we need to deliver is not about our compensation; it is about their access to health care in the future. They need to be encouraged to vote their interests, which are our interests as well.However, to maintain the respect of our patients, and the payors, and our credibility we must also continue to lead in the work of defining and practicing appropriate care. We've all seen adverse publicity about excessive Medicare payments to vascular specialists, including vascular surgeons.The economic impact of inappropriate and unnecessary care is enormous. In fact, in the contemporary U.S. health care system, it's been estimated that unnecessary procedures may account for as much as 2% of the gross domestic product, hundreds of billions of dollars each year in this country.In one study, it was noted that in one calendar year, from 25% to 42% of Medicare patients received at least one of 26 useless tests and treatments.Although the management of patients with circulatory disease represents a small part of this problem, and while these outrageous examples involve a tiny fraction of vascular practitioners, and while some of us believe that other specialties are the culprits, the unethical practices of just a few vascular surgeons can poison the reputation of our specialty as a whole across the board and destroy our credibility. Although it's not our responsibility, nor does the SVS have the resources or tools as a professional Society to regulate vascular care delivery or morality, we\u00a0should not andwe will not ignore the unethical practices of a few vascular surgeonsand allow them to reflect badly on all of us. We've taken note of these excesses and unethical practices, and we have acted. This year, we've introduced a detailed ethics clause into our requirements for membership. If approved at our business meeting, it will not be enough to do a sufficient number of vascular surgical cases, and do them well, to qualify for membership. If there is credible evidence that comes forward that an applicant for membership has engaged in the performance of inappropriate procedures, or unethical practices, that applicant will be disqualified for membership in our society! And, we also have expanded the scope of our Professional Conduct Committee to specifically focus on any ethical breaches by current members. This is our obligation to our patients and our membership as a whole. We will lead in this effort and set the example for other specialties!What we truly care aboutA couple years ago, our president introduced a patient who survived a ruptured aortic aneurysm. Well, I also have a few ruptured aneurysm survivors, and I'd like to close by telling you about one of them. I discussed this case a few years ago in another venue, but her story has now reached closure, and I thought it was worth revisiting. My patient's name is Henrietta. You all know her because she's the face ofallof your practices. Henrietta passed away a couple years ago at the age of 90. She was an average citizen, a member of the greatest generation. She spent much of her adult life working in a factory making burlap bags. She lived alone in her last years with her dog in a row house on a narrow street in East Baltimore, leading a simple and fairly sedentary life. Henrietta was 84 when I met her in our emergency department on a Wednesday afternoon. She had presented with several hours of severe abdominal pain.This is her CT [computed tomography] scan (,a), which demonstrates that she had a ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm. She also had a number of significant health problems, including severe coronary artery disease, atrial fibrillation, congestive heart failure, COPD [chronic obstructive pulmonary disease], hypertension, and hyperlipidemia.We had published an outcomes study in the 1990s using the Maryland state database, which documented an operative mortality rate of 67% among octogenarians undergoing open repair of a ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm, and that was for all comers.Henrietta's comorbidity, her Charlson Index, put her on the bad end of the bell-shaped curve and made it a long shot she\u00a0would survive repair. But, Henrietta did survive that\u00a0day, and went home to her dog, and lived for 6\u00a0more years!As I am certain you all will agree, Henrietta did not survive that day and live 6 more years because of any health care legislation coming out of Washington, D.C.! She did not survive that day because of the electronic health record or because of Meaningful Use. She did not survive because of the wisdom of any hospital administrator or insurance executive or because of any primary care physician! Henrietta survived that Wednesday and lived for 6 more years because of modern vascular surgery (,b)!She lived until the age of 90 because a brilliant young international member of the SVS from Buenos Aires, Argentina, Juan Parodi, dreamed and he cared and believed you could actually repair an aortic aneurysm through incisions in the groin\u2014an idea so preposterous at the time that theJournal of Vascular Surgeryrejected his first case report ().Now, please listen very carefully\u2014Sidawy and Perler were not the editors at the time. We did not make that decision. Henrietta survived that day because other vascular surgeons cared and helped to refine this novel technique of endovascular aneurysm repair. She survived that day and lived 6 good years because our industry partners believed in this technology, and believed in our specialty, and invested heavily in this technology, and worked with us to continually improve this revolutionary approach to aneurysm repair, as they continue to do today. And, let me be very clear: the Sunshine Act, and the Medicare Open Payment website notwithstanding, our partnership and collaboration with our industry colleagues is proper and ethical and critical to advancing the science of our field and improving and saving the lives of our patients. Industry needs the intellectual input of our innovative vascular surgical thought leaders, who should be compensated for their contributions; and our industry partners deserve to make a profit on their investments and not be penalized by a ridiculous device tax!James Collins, in his classic best selling business book,Good to Great, said \u201cFor in the end, it is impossible to have a great life, unless it is a meaningful life. And it is very difficult to have a meaningful life, without meaningful work.\u201dHe went on to say that \u201cyou might even gain that deepest of all satisfactions knowing that your short time on this earth has been well spent, and that it mattered.\u201dWe all belong to a truly exceptional, innovative, and vibrant specialty, and although our numbers are small, we areuniquein the care of patients with circulatory disease, not just because of the totality of care we deliver, and not because we're necessarily better, but much more importantly, because we care; we care deeply about what we do, our patients, and each other.My friends, when each of us comes to the end of that long, long road of our professional careers; when you've performed your last case, written your last paper, or attended your last staff meeting\u2014when each of us takes that sobering look in the mirror, how will that man or woman looking back at us, judge us? I would respectfully suggest that you will not be judged by how many cases you have performed or how any RVUs you accumulated; you will not be judged by how many papers you have published or how many important titles you have achieved; you will not be judged by the size of your homes or by the size of the estates you leave your families. I truly believe each of us will be judged by how we answer one simple question: Did you care? Did you care about what was really important?Henrietta\u2014a typical patient, a senior citizen, a Medicare beneficiary, part of the \u201cGreatest Generation,\u201d the face of all of our vascular surgery practices\u2014survived a ruptured aortic aneurysm and lived for 6 good years because the \u201cGreatest Generation\u201d deserves the greatest care, because what vascular surgeons do is important, and innovative, andunique, and meaningful, and becausewe care, and we love what we do, and our patients love us for it. And, there is nothing wrong with that. In fact, there is absolutely nothing better than that.Thank you all again so much for the honor of serving as your president this year and for listening to me this morning. But, most importantly, thank you for all you do for your patients every day of your incredibly meaningful, caring careers. God bless.Please see:.",
  "2017": "As I stand before you all, I am profoundly humbled to have served as your President this past year. Unlike my typical presentations over the past 20-plus years, my Presidential address this morning will not be a data-driven academic expos\u00e9. With your indulgence, I will take you on an abbreviated journey and share events that I hope will resonate with each of you. Clearly, these events had an impact on me, and I will try my best not to preach too much. This talk is not about science.My familyBefore we begin, I want to acknowledge more than a few people, some of whom are here today. First and foremost, my family. Julie and I met during the second month of my surgical internship at Penn in 1977 while I was rotating on neurosurgery. Although we each maintain drastically different versions of that first encounter, we have been together ever since and this August will be celebrating our thirty-seventh wedding anniversary. Within the larger context of the University of Pennsylvania, Julie is the one and only Dr Fairman (unless someone needs their aneurysm or carotid fixed). She is the Florence Nightingale Professor of Nursing in honor of nursing veterans. Her unwavering love, friendship, enduring support, and our partnership have sustained me. We have been blessed with two sons, Alex and Connor, who are both here today and make us incredibly proud parents. Alex just graduated Penn Med and will be starting his residency, and Connor, having majored in International Relations and East Asian studies at Penn, will be starting his master's degree. Our family became larger this past April when Alex married a lovely woman, Marisa, who is 1\u00a0year behind him in medical school. We have been more than fortunate as a family, and although like every family, we have suffered painful losses, we have created wonderful memories that strengthen us spiritually.Mentors and friendsClyde Barker has been my friend and mentor at Penn. Our relationship has evolved over more than 25\u00a0years, and I still rely on his intellect and council. He is an extraordinary individual; you get to know someone like Clyde once in a lifetime, if you are really lucky. It has never been entirely clear whether he relished his tennis career more than transplant and vascular surgery, but he has been extremely talented and accomplished at all three. During my training while working with him in the operating room, he had a sense of humor; he was always calm, fearless, and relaxed. I actually witnessed him lose it and curse once while operating: he quietly murmured the word damn. When I returned from the Vascular Annual Meeting (VAM) last year as President, Clyde of course congratulated me, and I noted how nice it was for both me and Penn that I was the first Penn President of the Society for Vascular Surgery (SVS). He immediately replied: \u201cNo, you are not, Julian Johnson was President of the SVS in 1961.\u201dJim May is here from Sydney, Australia. Jim's innovations and accomplishments over his remarkably successful career are well known to this audience, as they are around the globe. I first met Jim in Washington, D.C., in 1999 at a dinner where we were planning the start of a new percutaneous First in Man aortic stent graft trial, a 12F design. The trial failed miserably and quickly, but I continued to meet up with Jim yearly at the VEITH meeting and the International Endovascular Symposium, which was held in Sydney for several years. Sharing an appreciation for fine wine and good food, we initiated a series of not very scientific \u201cacademic dinners\u201d that continue to this day. Jim, thanks for joining us at this year's VAM.Frank Veith has received many accolades from past SVS\u00a0Presidents, including Bruce Perler last year. By virtue\u00a0of the VEITH Symposium, Frank has consistently done more to support the academic careers of vascular surgeons across the world than anyone I know. His passion and enthusiasm for our specialty is unrivaled, and I still need to find out what vitamins he is taking.The society for vascular surgeryAlthough I have only known and worked with Ken Slaw, our Executive Director, for 1\u00a0year, I would be remiss if I did not acknowledge him. While still President Elect of the SVS last spring, I chaired the search for a new Executive Director. Candidly, I was traumatized that I would not have Becky Maron to rely on this year. Our search committee unanimously supported hiring Ken, and I have been thrilled working with him. There are not enough positive adjectives to describe Ken's attributes. He is smart, capable, thoughtful, and perhaps most important, positive. He, Patricia Burton, our Deputy Director, and the entire SVS staff have made this past year an unforgettable experience that I will always cherish. Today, I also want to thank in particular the core SVS staff who have been essential to the success of this year's VAM.It is always dangerous to go on naming names and risk forgetting someone. My experiences within the SVS have deeply shaped me professionally and personally. As someone who is fundamentally introverted, the organization gave me opportunities to grow and contribute on a much larger playing field. I have been privileged to know many of our past Presidents, and I have reached out for advice to several of them this year; their enduring dedication to the SVS is remarkable. I have enjoyed working closely over the years on SVS committees with the late Jim Seeger and Roy Greenberg as well as more recently with Jon Matsumura, Cinny Shortell, and Ron Dalman. This past year, it has been a particular honor to work with a spirited Executive Committee, including Clem Darling, Mike Makaroun, Kim Hodgson, Ali Aburahma, Bruce Perler, Richard Lynn, and Tom Bower. They exemplify the concept of making it personal and commitment to service.Our division at pennI could have never survived this year without the consistent support of my Penn family. Some of you know Maureen Griffith, our divisional executive assistant, and Annemarie Leone, our divisional lead nurse practitioner. I have been blessed to work daily with these two dedicated professionals for many years. To our Penn faculty\u2014Clyde Barker, Ben Jackson, Grace Wang, Venkat Kalapatapu, Michael Golden, Paul Foley, Scott Damrauer, and Paul O'Donnell\u2014thank you all. Our fellows and residents graciously tolerated my regular distractions throughout this year. I am sure they are more than sick and tired of my usual refrain, \u201cSorry I am on a conference call. Can I call you back?\u201d Thank you Kathleen Lamb, Phil Battista, Julia Glaser, Jon Quatromoni, Anand Parikh, and Nathan Belkin.International vascular communityFinally, I want to acknowledge our international community of vascular surgeons, especially those practicing and training in the United States striving to provide sophisticated, high-quality vascular care to all patients regardless of their socioeconomic status. For them, these past months of uncertainty have been uniquely personal, threatening their livelihood, families, and dedication to service. We have a huge international presence here today. Thank you all for contributing to the success of this meeting.Personal reflectionsGetting to me, now\u2014yes, it is true I was born at Penn and I am still there. Although I was motivated to leave Philadelphia after medical school, I decided to do my general surgery residency at Penn so I could pursue a career in craniofacial surgery. I made the decision to pursue vascular surgery as a PGY-4 after I rotated as a \u201cjunior chief\u201d on the Penn vascular service for 3\u00a0months. I was drawn to many aspects of the specialty: really sick patients, the opportunity to do tons of surgery, fast pace, engagement of the faculty (some of whom I had already worked with on the transplant service), the work ethic of the faculty as role models, and my ability to assimilate vascular surgical concepts more quickly than other specialties I had been exposed to. The Penn vascular faculty included names you may recognize: Brook Roberts, Clyde Barker, Henry Berkowitz, and Len Perloff. My father worked hard his entire career, but I was struck by the endurance of these individuals. They had incredible energy, resiliency, and commitment. In short, they reminded me of professional athletes, but obviously with a much more daunting vision and mission, constantly striving to become better surgeons and to save more lives. It was all personal to them. The stakes were palpable, there was physical and emotional exhaustion, the successes and failures were obvious to everyone, and I wanted in. Although I flirted with doing my fellowship elsewhere, I was drawn to stay at Penn for largely two reasons: Julie was accepted into the PhD program at Penn, and Clyde Barker had become Chair of Surgery and I would be his Fellow.Leaving PennIgnoring the advice of Clyde Barker, I decided to start my own private practice after fellowship at one of our large affiliated hospitals. I had rotated there as a general surgery resident, and they clearly wanted and needed a full-time vascular surgeon on the staff. Julie and I went to a bank and took out a business loan, and I leased an office. For a number of years, it was a 24/7 work schedule, I built a large dedicated vascular practice, gave up doing general surgery after about 2\u00a0years, and began to pay off my loans from college and medical school. Almost before I knew it, I had a full-time office staff of seven people, was incorporated, and was running a business. I paid their raises and health insurance, funded their pensions, always before I could focus on my finances. After I couple of years, feeling good about my contributions to the hospital, I reached out to the chief financial officer and requested new imaging equipment for the noninvasive vascular laboratory of which I was the director. After delivering my proposal, he denied my request, and as if it was yesterday, I remember him saying, \u201cDr Fairman, you are a financial loser for our hospital.\u201d Just like that! He explained it was my length of stay. I had been doing ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysms approximately every 10\u00a0days or so and my length of stay was 9\u00a0days compared with the average national length of stay for a ruptured aortic aneurysm of 1.3\u00a0days. I was a loser because my patients were surviving. I was shocked that the chief financial officer of a large Philadelphia hospital had zero understanding of this. This was personal, and yes, I got the equipment for our vascular laboratory.I do recall one particular patient with a ruptured aneurysm, as if it was yesterday. I got the call from our residents about 2amand rushed into the hospital. When I arrived, he was very unstable, and we raced him up to the operating room. We had become quite efficient with these cases, and I had him open with a cross-clamp above the celiac relatively quickly. After I finished the proximal anastomosis and moved the clamp below the renals, we lost his rhythm and he flat lined. After about 20\u00a0minutes of cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), we were still without any spontaneous rhythm. He was cold, acidotic, and coagulopathic. By this time, one of our general surgeons who was in-house asked me if I wanted help. I asked him to scrub in and continue CPR while I went out to speak with the patient's wife. I found her in the family lounge and filled her in. I told her it was hopeless and I had tried my best, expecting she would understand. Instead, she calmly said, \u201cDr Fairman, you get back in there and keep trying. I never gave up when I got a letter from Uncle Sam in World War II that he was lost in action, and I will not allow you to give up tonight.\u201d I went back to the operating room, and while I continued CPR, the general surgery resident floated a pacer wire from subclavian vein access into the right ventricle, and we restored a paced rhythm. As this was before the current approach of damage control, we kept him in the operating room until I could reverse his hypothermia, acidosis, and coagulopathy, finally closing his belly two shifts later in the afternoon of the following day. By the next morning, we turned off his pacer and he was in normal sinus rhythm. He was extubated within 48\u00a0hours and remarkably was discharged home after about 10\u00a0days. I was astounded, his postoperative course was uncomplicated. A few hours after he was discharged, I received a call from him at my office. For the first time, he was experiencing some nausea and abdominal pain. I arranged for him to come into the emergency department, and I ordered an obstruction series. I got a call from the radiologist, and she suggested I come down to radiology. As I looked at the films, a wave of nausea overwhelmed me, and I recall becoming lightheaded. Clearly, there was a small cotton sponge I had inadvertently left in his belly. I sat down with him and his wife and explained I needed to take him back to the operating room and remove the sponge. A few days later, as he was ready for discharge, I again sat down with them. I explained the facts of the case and how all the official sponge counts were correct, but we used hundreds of sponges throughout the conduct of the operation and I missed this one sponge. I told him he would definitely get a large settlement if he decided to file a lawsuit, but I wanted to remain his doctor regardless. He looked at me and took both my hands into his. He said, \u201cMy children want me to sue; they figure I will die soon and they will end up with all the money. My wife and I realize what you did for us; there will be no lawsuit.\u201d For about the next 10\u00a0years, I received a yearly Christmas card from John and Marge. This was personal.Return to PennIn 1990, the health care market in Philadelphia was rapidly changing. Health maintenance organizations were replacing traditional insurance carriers, and the reality of my solo practice model was catching up to me. The specialty of vascular surgery in my view was stagnating, I was Chair of Surgery in a large community hospital, reimbursements were falling, I was frustrated by the lack of time I was spending with Julie and the boys, and I was missing too much of what I wanted out of life. I needed a new career model that would be sustainable in the long term; I needed to re-create my career. When I announced to the administration of my hospital that I would be closing my office and returning to Penn, there was initial good will, which rapidly turned to anger and resentment. Yes, they had figured out I was not a financial loser and I recall the apoplexy when they calculated all the lost downstream revenue, especially all those outpatient computed tomography scans I would no longer be ordering. And yes, the patients did follow me down to Penn. It was personal and I provided a valued service. I savored the relationships with my patients and their families. Over time, my current and former patients increasingly became my greatest source of referrals. I never would have anticipated this when I first started in practice.Returning to Penn was not easy. Although many of the senior surgeons welcomed me as an experienced clinical surgeon who had a large practice, there were others who thought I was just a \u201ccommunity practice surgeon\u201d without currency. Fueled by the desire to produce and achieve academically after a lapse of several years, I was able to take advantage of a new willingness to embrace clinical trials at Penn. There were lots of changes, including starting all over as an assistant professor. Probably the very best thing about returning to Penn was Clyde Barker. As Chairman and Division Chief, his style of mentorship was unique. He had the institutional clout to protect us as we forged ahead with new endovascular therapies. He led from behind. His commitment allowed us to advance endovascular aortic and carotid therapies, thereby redefining our practices and algorithms. The competition among our divisional faculty and the intrinsic differences between us fueled our productivity. We were in every aortic clinical trial, and our division became nationally recognized. Our graduates, many of whom you know, have gone on to become leaders in our specialty. Thanks to very many people in this audience, our specialty became more interesting again. I learned how to collaborate without giving up\u00a0ownership. I learned how to define and accomplish academic goals. And all along, Clyde Barker was there for all of us at Penn.When I returned to Penn in 1996, I was intrigued by the financial realities in our Department of Surgery. Our faculty were incentivized in a number of ways, depending on one's academic track, but collections and revenue were not part of the formula. Charges and later relative value units became the predominant methodology of measuring one's financial worth. As a former community practice surgeon who depended on revenue to support the practice, I found this approach surreal. Our divisions at Penn were supported by inter-entity transfers of dollars from the health system every year. Since 2001, when I became Division Chief, redefining and communicating the overall economic worth of a vascular surgeon at Penn became a constant reality and challenge.Sparing you the details, in 2007 I settled a malpractice case. I believed the medicine was good, but Penn is self-insured, and given the malpractice climate in Philadelphia, we decided it would be best to avoid a courtroom trial. Although more senior surgeons advised me to let it go as the cost of doing business, and Penn was very supportive, I was angry and crushed.This was personal. One of our general surgical faculty reminded me that vascular surgeons are like firemen. We race into emergencies and put out big fires, saving lives and limbs in the process, but not always. There was something else happening in 2007 that I was able to take advantage of during this brief dark time.Commitment to serveDavid Gillespie put together a volunteer program in Landstuhl, Germany, to provide increased vascular support for our wounded soldiers coming in from Iraq and Afghanistan. As part of the first wave of volunteers (Ruth Bush lead the way), I signed on and went for a 2-week tour of duty in the fall of 2007. I was incredibly busy helping to provide care for the horribly wounded young men and women who were triaged to Landstuhl Hospital multiple times a day. Whatever small contributions I may have made during my time there, I recovered my sense of service, duty, and mission. The experience, although sobering in every way, allowed me to heal and carry on in my career with renewed purpose. Between 2007 and 2014, 177 SVS members did tours of duty at Landstuhl. In fact, 28 SVS members did multiple tours of duty. Talk about making it personal and commitment to service!Finances of vascular surgeryIn anticipation of this Presidential address and in order to measure thefinancialcomponent of worth and service within our Vascular Division at Penn, I initiated meeting regularly with the Penn administration last fall. I recall how quickly the community hospital administration calculated their lost downstream revenue when I closed my private practice in 1996. Yet in my yearly divisional budget negotiations, whenever I brought up the subject of vascular downstream revenue at Penn, I was told it could not be calculated; our health system was just too large and complex. So after months of persistence, here is what I have learned about the financial worth of Penn Vascular Surgery within the University of Pennsylvania Health System (UPHS). Keep in mind we are and have always been a relatively small division in terms of numbers of faculty and clinical full-time equivalents (cFTEs).Across all medical services at two of our downtown entities (Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania and Penn Presbyterian Medical Center) for the year 2015, combining inpatient and outpatient, our seven division members working at these entities generated $35 million in net patient revenue, yielding a total contribution margin of $9.5 million. Looking at this per cFTE or individual vascular surgeon yields $9 million in net patient revenue and a total contribution margin of $2.5 million. Compared with our colleagues in the Heart and Vascular Service Line, this places us below cardiac surgery and above cardiology. On a per encounter basis, the profitability trend across various insurers (Medicare, Medicaid, and commercial) is consistent for all three specialties in the Heart and Vascular Service Line. On a sobering note in 2015, our inpatient contribution margin declined compared with prior years, fueled by large increases in admissions from our emergency department as well as emergency transfers from other facilities. These are high-acuity patients who have longer lengths of stay and are most often insured through Medicare and Medicaid. For those of you not familiar with the Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act enacted in 1986 (EMTALA), we are not allowed to refuse a transfer from another emergency department. Although not required under EMTALA, our division has always accepted inpatient transfer requests from other hospitals. Emergency department admissions and transfers more than double our length of stay compared with elective admissions, and length of stay in this population is the biggest driver of cost, and that hurts our margin. In terms of our secondary contribution, we are doing a lot of work for everyone else in the health system. Approximately 30% of our inpatient procedures consist of helping other surgeons; the majority are related to complex cardiac surgeries that are highly profitable. For every dollar we primarily generate on the inpatient side, at least another dollar is generated for other services. And finally looking at the downstream revenue over 180\u00a0days from our outpatient clinic, we generate $1.7 million in contribution margin per cFTE or vascular surgeon, comparable to interventional cardiology and electrophysiology.We manage three noninvasive vascular laboratories in these two downtown entities. Although the laboratories are used across many specialties on both inpatient and outpatient encounters, our own divisional use on the outpatient side accounts for more than 50% of the studies, and this outpatient contribution margin is huge. So what did I learn from this exercise? For the first time, I have a true sense of financial transparency, and I regret that I did not take this initiative before. The process generated enthusiasm among all the participants, and I realized the administration was seeing some of these data for the first time, just as I was. The administration now clearly understands how hard our faculty work day and night and how we take a financial hit on all the daily emergencies and transfers. The administration realizes that unlike other divisions in Penn Surgery, our faculty are neveroff serviceand have negligible protected time. They realize we are the \u201cfiremen\u201d in the hospital and we always go the distance for the benefit of our patients. With the support of administration, we will collectively implement strategies to manage inpatient and operating room costs, grow revenue, increase the clinical productivity of our faculty, focus on reducing length of stay and readmissions, and do very simple things such as shifting our use of the noninvasive vascular laboratory as well as noninvasive cardiac testing and radiologic imaging such as computed tomography angiography and magnetic resonance angiography to the outpatient side whenever possible. Other efforts to improve our payer mix, reduce the large overhead within a large academic medical center, increase our referral base of commercially insured patients, reduce our acuity, and perform more bread and butter procedures on the elective side of our practice are not insurmountable but more challenging. Perhaps for the first time, I have finally established a dialogue with the administration considering such fundamental concepts as the value of a carotid intervention vs the financial cost of a stroke. This was not a threatening or intimidating process; it was constructive. Vascular surgeons are not financial losers for a health system! Quite the contrary, they are big winners.The importance of administrative and clinical leadership positionsSome years ago, Dan Clair gave an important talk at the Crawford Critical Issue Symposium titled \u201cHow vascular surgeons can succeed as hospital employees.\u201d He described how he made sure the members of his department had important jobs in addition to their clinical duties at the Cleveland Clinic. This resonated with me because I was following the same strategy at Penn. For example, I have been Chair of the UPHS New and Existing Technology and Supply Chain Committee for many years. We oversee and approve all corporate purchasing across all our entities. The process is physician driven at all the hospital entities and we have incorporated the developing service lines. In 2013, we implemented Epic OpTime, allowing real-time cost capture and analysis by procedure and physician as well as supply cost variation between physicians. Service line and surgeon summary reports provide transparency across our entities. The administration clearly places value on this service. Looking across our division, my faculty all have other jobs that provide important contributions to the health system. They serve as directors of our noninvasive vascular laboratories, they lead quality unit-based programs in collaboration with nursing, manage our vascular database and Vascular Quality Initiative (VQI) registries across multiple subspecialties and entities, are directors for our residency and fellowship training programs, and are leaders in medical student and general surgical education. Our faculty have administrative and clinical leadership positions within the Heart and Vascular Service Line and most recently initiated and direct the vascular disease team across subspecialties and four entities. The faculty consistently mentor undergraduate Penn students as well as international physicians and students who frequently come to the university. We sit on academic promotion committees, and our divisional services, whether they be clinical, academic, or administrative, are essential to the department of surgery and the UPHS. Our long-standing successful collaboration with advanced practice providers, in our case nurse practitioners, on both the inpatient and outside side has been an enviable model and has been copied across the health system. We provide a huge service to the institution irrespective of our financial worth. Yet as far as I believe we have evolved at Penn in establishing the worth of our vascular division, it is uncanny how I continue to be surprised and challenged.A few weeks ago, we received our Vizient dashboard from the last quarter of 2016. This is a clinical outcome report that looks at risk-adjusted mortality and is used as a periodic comparison to peers. It is an administrative data set that is diagnosis-related group based and uses service line methodology. Fundamentally, it is coded, nonvalidated billing data. The diagnosis-related groups are unique in that they are split among multiple service lines within the Vizient Data Base and are not limited to the Vascular Surgery Service Line. Whereas cardiac surgery and cardiology performed within the target range, we performed worse than the target range of performance greater than 50% of the peer group. When I questioned our administration, they did not know how exactly the data are abstracted by Vizient, yet the health system pays for this analysis. Grace Wang, who heads up our divisional quality work and VQI, took a deep dive, and we were most surprised by her findings. Over 50% of the cases in this vascular outcome report were not attributable to vascular surgery at all. Many were in fact attributable to cardiac surgery and cardiology, thereby changing their overall performance and improving ours. This was personal. We have ready access to our outcome data through the SVS VQI, and we know how we perform compared with our region as well as nationally. Our outcomes are transparent. It has been a slow process, but the Penn Health System is finally embracing the SVS VQI. Since 2011, when we joined the SVS VQI, we struggled to pay for the subscription fees and FTE support from our divisional revenue. Since July 2017, the VQI at Penn has been rolled out to all multidisciplinary physician stakeholders who perform vascular interventions at four different entities, and the health system has assumed all the costs. Vascular outcomes at Penn will no longer be tracked using the National Surgical Quality Improvement Program.SVS is growingAs your President this past year, I worked hard with the Executive Committee, Executive Director, Deputy Director, and SVS staff to ensure that our visions as a Society were strongly aligned with both our vision for the future of vascular surgery and our activities. Your SVS has led the way in advancing quality outcomes and the worth of our membership through the commitment of the Patient Safety Organization VQI leadership, our practice guideline writing groups, our government relations work, our Medicare Evidence Development & Coverage Advisory Committee representation, and emphasis on vascular wellness and appropriateness of care. This past\u00a0year, the SVS Patient Safety Organization actually brokered a partnership with the government for reimbursement. We have been diligent working to improve our relationships with other organizations who share the vascular space. We can and should create a culture whereby other societies and foundations, such as the Society for Vascular Nursing, the American Venous Forum, the Society for Vascular Ultrasound, the American Heart Association, and others, will want to partner and affiliate with us. These essential relationships will not weaken us; rather, they will strengthen our brand.The VAM clearly has become a \u201ccan't miss\u201d annual multidisciplinary international meeting relevant to our entire membership. The number of concurrent sessions with other societies seems to grow exponentially each year. We are embarking on a new and exciting branding initiative with the American College of Surgeons; it is a vascular validation project to essentially create vascular centers of excellence, and Tony Sidawy will spearhead this effort. This will be of vital importance to the future success of our specialty, and you will hear more about this over the next year.Efforts are currently under way for the SVS to move into the accreditation space and support our membership who increasingly practice in outpatient centers. Our membership includes many who have particular expertise in this realm; this will not be a stretch for us. In addition to aligning around quality and value, we are aligned around advocacy, practice, education, the vascular team, and you, our membership. Finally, representatives from our community practice membership have been integrated into the SVS leadership and our governance. Look around at your colleagues; we are a culturally diversified society of men and women with a shared vision for the future success of our specialty. For me, this has been an extraordinary year. The vision of the SVS has never been stronger, we have the talent and resources we need to support our activities, and we are positioned, perhaps as never before, to be the hope of all our members and their patients.My worst case was my best caseI have one more story to tell this morning. It should resonate with all of you because we all remember our worst cases and often forget our best cases. How about a worst case that became a best case?This case is about a 16-year-old boy with a contained rupture of an innominate artery pseudoaneurysm. He had a history of a mediastinal T-cell lymphoma treated by chemotherapy and mediastinal irradiation therapy at age 14\u00a0years. He developed tracheal stenosis requiring multiple tracheostomies and complex airway reconstructive surgeries. In March 2004, he presented with an innominate-tracheal fistula requiring emergency open repair by proximal and distal ligation of the innominate artery and repair of the trachea with a pedicle pericardial flap. He initially recovered well without a neurologic deficit. The airway reconstruction broke down, requiring first a pectoralis flap and then a mediastinal tracheostomy with omental flap. In October 2004, he developed contained pseudoaneurysm at the site of the ligated proximal stump of the innominate artery. Coil embolization of the neck and central cavity of the pseudoaneurysm was initially successful but was repeated twice for recurrence of flow. All of this excellent care was performed by the physicians at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia. On Christmas Eve, December 2004, he presented with bleeding through his mediastinal tracheostomy with airway compromise. There were externally visible coils extruding through his tracheostomy at the head of a tense, mediastinal pulsatile upper mediastinal mass. He was placed on hospice care at Children's Hospital, and we were called by the patient's father to be sure there were no other options. Someone at Childrens' Hospital told him we had an inventory of\u00a0stents at Penn that might be applicable. Omaida Velazquez spearheaded transferring him directly to our hybrid suite, and an arteriogram revealed re-expansion of the pseudoaneurysm with open flow from the aortic arch and dispersion of the coils into the periphery of the pseudoaneurysm. We believed that manipulation or intubation of his airway would result in free rupture and exsanguination, so airway control was accomplished with cardiopulmonary bypass under local anesthesia, followed by intravenous general anesthesia. Multiple access attempts failed because of the prior fields of irradiation. Our final access attempt was achieved by retrograde introduction of the stent graft delivery system into the ascending aorta through the left common carotid artery while antegrade cerebral perfusion was maintained from the cardiopulmonary bypass circuit. We obliterated flow into the innominate pseudoaneurysm and preserved flow into the left carotid. He woke up neurologically intact and was discharged home on day 5. This was done with a team of Penn physicians on Christmas Eve that included vascular and cardiac surgeons, cardiac anesthesiologists, and a neurologist. As of 2009, Colin was a 22-year-old junior majoring in English at a local liberal arts college. Over the years, his imaging revealed continued exclusion of his innominate-tracheal fistula. Sadly, Colin passed away this past year, 12\u00a0years following our procedure, succumbing to progressive respiratory deterioration and sepsis from his prior irradiation therapy and chemotherapy. This experience was highly personal. All of you here today have these stories to tell.Pearls to trainees and younger colleaguesIn the final moments of this address, with your continued indulgence, please allow me to preach to our younger audience. As a baby boomer, here are my \u201cpearls.\u201d Your career is not a sprint, it's a marathon. There will be highs and lows; always go the distance. We have so many tools available to us today, I remain in awe of our ability to maintain life and function. Keep as many balls in the air as possible, collaborate whenever possible, but retain ownership. All administrative things can be taken away from you; your clinical reputation and practice cannot be. Former patients will be your most enduring referral base. Don't be afraid to make career changes and fail. Remain flexible, reinvent yourself, and learn to embrace change. Don't flip out too often. Don't be a prisoner of your career. Take trips, create memories, rejuvenate yourself, and retain professional passion. Start\u00a0new programs, embrace your history, grow up and become a mentor, maintain perspective, fend off burnout, and remember the mission is to serve our patients. For those of you working with trainees, always remember how you felt being a resident. Be compassionate; our very best perk is our ability to navigate the best health care for our family and loved ones. But above all else, keep your eye on the prize, those things that keep you human, grounded, and help you maintain your humility.A career in vascular surgeryFinally, what's so great about a career in vascular surgery? You get to operate all over the body. You can do big open cases and lots of minimally invasive cases. You can have a large office practice just like a primary care practitioner and still do lots of surgery. You will forge relationships with patients lasting many years. Your patients will be of all ages and acuity, just like Rachel, who is now 12\u00a0years old; when she was 4\u00a0months old, Omaida Velazquez and I repaired a large isolated iliac artery aneurysm. You will make friends and have colleagues from around the globe. You will have many opportunities for clinical research and discovery, and you can tailor your practice as you age. You will make it highly personal and you will make a difference to your patients through a career of service.Service is deeply personalShirley Chisholm was a U.S. Congresswoman representing New York's 12th District for 7\u00a0years from 1968 to 1983. She became the first African American woman elected to Congress. In 1972, she became the first African American candidate for President of the United States. She won 162 delegates at the convention that year. Shirley Chisholm noted: \u201cService is the rent we pay for the privilege of living on this earth. It has religious, ethical, and justice overtones.\u201d Marion Write Edelman, Founder and President of the Children's Defense Fund, elaborated on Chisholm's quote: \u201cService is the rent we pay to be living. It is the very purpose of life and not something you do in your spare time.\u201d I have no doubt they were thinking about and referring to you, the members of the Society for Vascular Surgery. As vascular surgeons, we have a purpose to serve patients. That is what gets us up every morning and keeps us operating at night. Service is the rent we pay for the privilege of patient care. It is deeply personal.Colleagues, thank you for allowing me to be your President this past year. In this highly dangerous and volatile world we live in today, may God bless all of us and our mission to our patients.",
  "2018": "Success through team supportBeing president of the Society for Vascular Surgery (SVS) is the highlight of my career, not only professionally but personally for me, for my family, and for my partners in Albany. I would like to thank Michel Makaroun for his wonderful introduction, although most of it may not be true. I attended my first SVS meeting when I was 6\u00a0years old with my parents, and at that point, it was mostly a scientific spectacle; but for my father, the SVS meeting was much more important than being president of the United States. And my father, who I loved dearly, although it took a long time to get there, deserved this position more than I. He did not achieve it because of his personality quirks, personal misadventures, and disregard for authority.I would like to acknowledge the incredible hard work, expertise, and support from the executive committee of the SVS under the expert guidance of Ken Slaw, Patricia Burton, and Elsa Hall.I thank Ron Fairman, Michel Makaroun, Kim Hodgson, Sam Money, Ali AbuRahma, Mike Belkin, and Bill Shutze for their diligence, friendship, and vision. I am proud that we have made great strides in building a Society that serves all the varied practices, those that serve the community and also the academic centers. We strive to serve you and your patients each and every day.I also want to thank the many past presidents who have put the SVS on a powerful and stable course.There are too many to thank, but Tony Sidawy has always given me sage political advice; Peter Gloviczki, a close friend who nominated me; Ramon Buerger, who gave me my first SVS position; Frank Veith and Jim Stanley threw me headfirst into the political arena; Rich Cambria, Hazim Safi, and Greg Sicard have been technical inspirations.Family as a teamAlthough I love what I do, and I annoyingly treat each day at work as if it were opening presents at Christmas, my first team is my family ().I met my wife, Julie, 45\u00a0years ago in college. I was at preseason football camp and she was an incoming freshman. On Christmas break, I knew she and her parents were going to Miami Beach, so my friend and I drove 2000 miles to Miami to pretend we were \u201cjust in the neighborhood\u201d for a visit. After that, we have been inseparable. She has supported me and our family and has raised three incredible kids, many times without me or in spite of me. Without her, I would still be listening to loud music in my room or in jail. I would never have ventured to Paris or Nairobi for work and never be standing up here without her support, dedication, and love. I love you dearly, Julie.And yes \u2026 someday we will take a month off. After my training, where I was on call every night for a year, I promised we would take a month off, but it never happened. On June 27, at the end of my fellowship, I thought I had my first weekend off, and as I was swimming with the kids, my beeper went off. It was the operating room (OR). They said, \u201cYour ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm is on the table.\u201d I said, \u201cI'm not the fellow on call anymore.\u201d They answered, \u201cWe know. Dr Shah said you are now the attending on call.\u201dAs I mentioned, one of Julie's greatest feats was to raise three wonderful children. I'm so proud of who they are and the incredible people they have become. They all are smart, hardworking, honest, wonderful people who I cannot say enough about.Clem works and lives in California. He is truly an inspiration. To see him perform defines passion. He has excelled in most art forms: music, screenplays, stand-up comedy. He's following his dream and has an artful sense of humor, and his ability to put himself out there without a safety net is spellbinding.Jeremy is a second-year medical student, just recently married 2\u00a0weeks ago to Laura, who is a wonderful woman getting her PhD in psychology. I can't leave out mentioning their dog Butter. Jeremy is one of the hardest workers I know. He has worked hard for Marc Schermerhorn, has already presented at the Vascular Annual Meeting three times, and published more than 32 peer-reviewed papers. He's serious, analytic, determined, and the most focused individual I've ever met in my life.And last but not least, my wonderful daughter Melanie, who has been a true inspiration. Not only is she brilliant, but she is thoughtful, caring, and determined. She is getting her master's degree in somatic psychology. She is independent, has traveled abroad working on organic farms, and is bolder and more fearless than I will ever be. She is going to be a wonderful therapist and asset to the world. She makes this world a better place, and she makes me a better person.Now, I'll tell you a couple of stories about each. When I first started, I was on call most weekends. One weekend, I was making pancakes for my children as a surprise. My oldest son wakes up, looks at me, and says, \u201cDid you get fired?\u201d I said, \u201cNo.\u201d And he replied, \u201cAre you sure?\u201d Wow, they really weren't used to me being home.Jeremy once asked me when he was about 10\u00a0years old, \u201cHow come all the other fathers stay home on weekends and you always go to work?\u201d and I said, \u201cWell, because I make more than they do.\u201d He looked at me, paused, and said, \u201cWell, can we give some of that money back?\u201d In the end, he was the one to choose medicine as a career.I took Melanie to work with me on Bring Your Daughter to Work Day. I showed her what I thought were impressive operations and really complicated problems. I thought she would be impressed. That evening, I asked her, \u201cWhat's the thing you liked the most about today?\u201d She turned to me, thoughtfully, and said \u201cWhat I liked the most is all the doctors called you Dr Darling, and all the janitors called you Clem.\u201d Again, tremendous insight from my intelligent and insightful daughter.I love you and am so proud of you all. Thank you for all the happiness and joy you bring into my and others' lives.I also want to thank my sisters Cindy, Wendy, and Elisabeth as well as \u201ccousins\u201d for their resilience, love, and support. Also, my friends and the dogs who have helped me in more ways than I can name (especially the dogs).Also, I want to mention my wife's parents and our Clan.Wisdom from the pastMy talk today is \u201cLooking forward through the past and changingmetowein the evolution of team-based vascular care.\u201dAfter more than five decades of working in an OR as a tech, a student, and a surgeon, I have found a few take home concepts to be particularly useful, and I hope you do as well.1.I believe Einstein was right when he said, \u201cNone of us is as smart as all of us.\u201d We learn from each other, which is the foundation of team-based training.\u201cBy three methods we may learn wisdom: First, by reflection, which is noblest; second by imitation, which is easiest; third by experience, which is the bitterest.\u201d\u2014 Confucius2.The key to resilience, healing, and health, whether for our patients or for ourselves, is caring and supporting each other more. We need to support each other for our personal health, for our patients, and for our specialty.\u201cFacts do not cease to exist because they are ignored.\u201d\u2014 Aldous Huxley, Complete Essays 2, 1926-19293.Failure is not an end result. It is the path to success through learning.\u201cSuccess consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm.\u201d\u2014 Winston Churchill4.Remember the past but look to the future. The best predictor of future behavior is the past, but the future we are experiencing now is like no other!\u201cLife can only be understood backwards; but it must be lived forwards.\u201d\u2014 S\u00f8ren KierkegaardThe evolution of vascular surgery and surgical education was not pretty, and I was lucky enough to see much of it firsthand. We have come a long way, however; many times we think we are more advanced then we really are.The practice in Albany: a great team and role modelsI cherish each of the parts of our team, but Dhiraj Shah deserves this honor more than anyone else I know. Excellent technical surgeon, educator, leader, and friend, he with Bob Leather and Alistare Carmody established the practice that I have the honor to presently steward.Ben Chang, my surgical soul mate, helped me be a better thinker and surgeon, and it is rare to have the privilege of saying you've done thousands of operations together; Sean Roddy, a close friend, coder extraordinaire, and brilliant, hardworking clinician; the organized and thoughtful Paul Kreienberg, who has run our residency and helped educate our fellows and residents. Both Paul and Sean counterbalance my aggressive surgical style and made me realize some are emotionally suited to build airplanes while others build parachutes. Jeff Hnath, who has run our outpatient facility beautifully and is as endo skilled and fearless as anyone I know; John Byrne, Devon Bock, and Courtney Warner, who rule the North Country; and the group that I can only refer to as \u201cvascular wonder women\u201d: Molly Shah, Chin-Chin Yeh, Stephanie Saltzberg, Courtney Warner, Xzabia Caliste, and Adriana Laser, who are skilled vascular surgeons and such great assets to our program.I am proud that we have a representative number of women in our practice, not for any socially conscious reason, rather that we hire the best and most capable. These women and men make me proud as vascular surgeons.Also, and especially, I must extend my deepest thanks to Jane Mangan, who's worked with me for 20\u00a0years and run our entire academic, scholastic, and work life. She has probably written more papers than I have; she at least has corrected more than I've ever read. Jane and more recently Fredd Brewer have been invaluable assets to me and the group. They, with their attention to detail, completeness, and organization, make up for many of my faults. They are worth my weight in gold, and we could not do what we do without them. Thank you, Jane and Fredd.Karen Fitzgerald has been with us for more than 30\u00a0years as a vascular nurse, is a past president of the Society for Vascular Nursing, and as head of nursing for our group has done a tremendous job of teaching hundreds of nurses the intricacies of vascular disease and vascular patient care for our practice and beyond. I would be remiss if I didn't mention the late Kate Fitzgerald, who created and ran our vascular registry. Without her, I would not have had an academic career.We could not exist without our well-trained vascular nurse clinicians, nurse practitioners, physician assistants, vascular laboratory techs, floor and vascular intensive care unit (ICU) nurses, and support from administrators like our practice manager, John Sano. Abdul Khan has been our lead tech for more than 20\u00a0years, and he is indispensable. I would also like to thank our Chief of Surgery, Steve Stain; our CEO, Jim Barba; Fred Venditti; and Steve Frisch for his support establishing our vascular ICU as well as the tremendous infrastructure needed to run our extensive network. This system was built with the goal of excellent patient care without concern for pulling patients into the system but rather providing the best care and support for the region. And last, I want to thank our fellows, who have suffered with me and made our patients' lives better. I am very proud to have been involved in your training.My father and mother as role modelsI've been exposed to this wondrous specialty for almost my entire life. I was born when my father was a surgical resident, and my mother was the backbone of the family. She supported us not only financially but also emotionally. She was sweet, funny, and fiercely loyal. I learned the value of hard work, technique, and tenacity from my father, but my mother showed me how I could have those qualities and still be positive and caring. I learned that one can get a lot more done with a smile instead of a threat.As a 12-year-old, I remember my father telling my sister Cindy and me that \u201cfor every dollar we spend, these hands have to make two, and this gravy train is not going to last forever.\u201d That's when I got my first job.When I was 15, my mother realized that my relationship with my father was strained and she suggested I apply for a job in the hospital. I met Jeff Raines, who was finishing his PhD at Massachusetts Institute of Technology on the pulse volume recording. He was working with my father and Steve Holford on developing noninvasive technology. My first hospital job was to help solder the motherboards and do pulse volume recordings.I must mention that Dr Jeff Raines is truly also one of the pioneers of noninvasive peripheral vascular imaging. He was also extremely active in duplex ultrasound with Gene Strandness, did some of the early studies on the prevention of deep venous thromboses with sequential compression boots with Bill Harris at the Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH), and also designed the first autotransfuser at the MGH. He was grossly under-recognized and really deserves credit for pushing us forward with many of our mechanical technologies ().Eventually, I became an OR tech working with the vascular team. This also made me realize how important the team concept is in providing comprehensive care. Each person had his or her role, each respected for their expertise and each committed to a \u201cshared vision.\u201d It didn't matter if you were a nurse, surgeon, tech, or staff; if you did your job, you were rewarded, and if you didn't, there was hell to pay. To me, this was a simple and straightforward world.My father, in his own unique discourse, explained it to me in his misanthropic way. One time, he took me on rounds, and we met this woman who was a maintenance person emptying the wastebaskets. As we walked in, my father greeted her very, very nicely. He asked her how she was doing, asked about her family, introduced me, and thanked her for her hard work. Two minutes later we ran into the Chief of Vascular Surgery, not one of his favorite people. My father then starts berating his chief, finally saying, \u201cThis is my son, Clemmie, and I'm taking him to the operating room. The operating room is where vascular surgeons operate. You may want to come up and visit it some time.\u201d As we walked away, I was startled at that interaction, even as an 8-year-old. I turned to my father and asked him, \u201cWhy are you so nice to the lady and so nasty to the man?\u201d He turned red faced and said, \u201cBecause she works, and he doesn't.\u201d Note to self, working hard is good.As I mentioned, my father was a driven, intelligent, hardworking surgeon who did not tolerate fools well and had a Machiavellian approach to teaching or getting things done. I will probably make a few people uncomfortable here as I go through some of the stories of my father, but that was generally his modus operandi. He loved to make people uncomfortable, no matter who you were or how old or important you were. His sister once tried to confront him about his condescending attitude and said, \u201cRalph, I'm not as stupid as you think I am!\u201d and his response was, \u201cYou couldn't possibly be!\u201dMy father had this propensity to say nasty and colorful things to people just loud enough so they could hear him. In one of my early memories of the SVS meeting, as we walked through the entrance, he pointed to a vascular surgeon and turned to me and said, \u201cSee that man over there? Most people are stupid, but that man is exceptional.\u201dOf course, the physician heard this and turned toward my father irately, and my mother gently went up to him, softly put her hand on his arm, and said, \u201cDon't worry, he's not talking about you.\u201d She mostly defused the situation, which somewhat aggravated my father, but that was her superpower, being able to minimize the damage done by my father's artful tongue. Unfortunately, she was not always there to protect him from himself.He could be a bear to deal with, but there was no one in the world that could deal with my father better than my mother. She was one of the strongest, loyal, and most perceptive people I know. She was instrumental in keeping our family team together. My father was difficult, emotionally challenged, and with a very short fuse; he was feared by many. But to my surprise, when I started working with him, I found he was adored by most of his fellows and residents. He was a stern taskmaster. However, he was extremely supportive of those people he trained, and as I worked with him, I was shocked at how somebody who could be so difficult could also be so adored.The women in my life as role modelsI have been lucky to be raised by incredibly strong women\u2014my mother, my sisters, my wife, my daughter, my staff at work, and my women partners. You all have had an incredibly stabilizing influence on me, and I thank you. Your passion to protect me and support me is sometimes undeserved, but your mother would be proud. Much like my mother, my family was my passion. I wanted to work in an environment that rewards taking care of your family as well as your patients. I thank my partners for their help in creating that environment and indulging my vision.My path to this esteemed position is circuitous at best, and one of the invaluable things I have learned is the value of failure, evaluating the past to avoid the same mistakes and the benefit of theteamin providing support and care.Vascular teamsThe concept of team-based care is well established in the history of surgery. Most advances occurred not by surgeons conceptualizing solutions in a vacuum but by working in a group of dedicated individuals with a shared vision. Each person, no matter what their position, was treated with respect. Their input, critical thought, and ability to question the hypothesis were equal to the boss. Everybody's quest was \u201cto do the right thing\u201d and get the correct answer, learning equally from failure as well as success.During the 70s when I was an OR tech, we had no self-retaining retractors, such as the Buckwalter, the Omni, or the Thompson. What we did have was surgical technologists whose sole job was to retract the bowel during large open cases, such as abdominal aortic aneurysms. To put this in perspective, in those days, open surgery after completing an aneurysm, at least at MGH where I worked, every patient got a Witzel gastrostomy tube, which was taken out in the office to get the nasogastric tube out early and prevent pulmonary complications. Interestingly enough, if you look back at the data from that era, mortality for open aneurysm repair was less than 2%, which many would have a hard time repeating in these days and times. One thing I did notice was how well choreographed the OR was because of the team responsibilities.As authoritative as my father and many of the surgeons of his time were, each had their own private scrub nurse who knew exactly what instruments, sutures, and retractors they needed. There was one time when I was working with one of the pancreatic surgeons at the Lahey Clinic, Dr John Brasch, who was well known in his specialty. A senior resident tried to impress Dr Brasch by knowing what he specifically used for his pancreatic anastomoses. However, Dr Brasch had absolutely no idea what sutures he used. The resident turned to the scrub nurse and said, \u201cWe will use the 3-0 and 4-0 Vicryl for this anastomosis.\u201d The nurse sharply responded to the resident, \u201cDr Brasch will use what I give him.\u201d As we all learned in our residency, there was a direct pecking order in that era, and the residents were not even close to the top, but the scrub nurses and technologists that worked with those surgeons daily as part of the team knew the dance, and there was almost no verbal communication needed to perform these exquisitely complicated operations.This team effort is what I fully attribute to the incredible outcomes during that time period despite rudimentary ICU and anesthesia care. It even morphed, at least in the MGH system, to have one single anesthesiologist do most or all the aortic work. Dr Kenny Davidson, for many years, was the Chief of Vascular Anesthesia if not the only anesthesiologist who was used during big operations.Failures as a bridge to successThere were some bumps in the road as I became a physician. After working with my father, I decided that I would never want a career in medicine, nor ever want to be a surgeon and never, ever go into vascular surgery. I saw his extreme passion but also his personal implosion due to the stress and constant battles internally and externally. It was too consuming.I also saw how our specialty was built on success through failure. These were long cases with little relief. Every anastomosis had to be perfect. In the words of Dr Linton, \u201cIf you don't have time to do it right the first time, when will you have time to do it over again?\u201d Anastomoses were routinely taken down until they were perfect. Training was brutal. Some residency programs didn't allow you to be married. Residents were routinely fired. I can still hear the insults tossed onto the fellows and resident. \u201cYou operate like a veterinary gynecologist.\u201d \u201cUse both hands or one will atrophy and fall off.\u201d \u201cAre you stupid or you just don't care?\u201d or my favorite, \u201cSon, are you sleeping with this patient's wife? Then why are you trying to kill him?\u201d I was amazed by the determination and intensity these surgeons brought to their work every day. It was impressive but also overwhelming. The only thing I knew was that I didn't want to go into medicine and I was definitely sure I wound never be a surgeon and I was damn sure I would never, ever, ever go into vascular surgery.After hearing my father's comments to his fellows, what he said to my sisters and me didn't seem so bad. It also left an impression on me that despite his criticism, he was respected by his fellows, which was enlightening. I wanted to find my passion, something special. The one thing I knew was that I was never going to go into medicine, never ever go into surgery, and definitely never, ever go into vascular surgery.After college, I took 3\u00a0years off to work with Judah Folkman, Bob Langer, and Jay Vacanti. I became a trusted part of a team where I was supported and valued. With Dr Folkman's support, I eventually got into medical school while taking night classes, being on call for the MGH, and working for Dr Folkman for the day. He taught me hard work, independent analytic thought, and rigorous scientific evaluation.Once I was accepted to medical school, I thought I was home free, but it was not to be. My Chief of Surgery in medical school took a particular negative interest in me, either my heritage or my laid-back approach. I needed an 80 for honors in surgery on my final exam, and somehow the Chief of Surgery showed up at my test. As I approached the proctor to hand in my exam, he took my paper and said, \u201cI'm going to grade this myself.\u201d Without reading a word he wrote 79, not good enough, and left. I never found out exactly why, but he informed me he would do all he could to make sure I did not get a surgical residency. But I relied on my father's gentle supportive words of wisdom when I was younger, \u201cI don't think you're smart enough to know how stupid you are.\u201d Most would consider this negatively, but for me it was rather emotionally freeing. You cannot allow others to dictate your future. Failure, no matter how arbitrary, would not define me. I had nothing to lose, so I persisted. I applied to surgical residency, and Dr McDermott, who was the chief of surgery at the Deaconess, on reviewing my application, looked at me right in the eyes, kind of smiled, and said, \u201cYou're Chief of Surgery hates you,\u201d and I said, \u201cYes sir, I think he does.\u201dDespite that, I was accepted to his surgical residency program and went through residency. I decided I was going to ultimately be a liver transplant surgeon but do a vascular fellowship first, and so I applied. I had a good application, was considered a strong resident, and again, maybe because of my cavalier approach, when I opened my match envelope, it said \u201cnone.\u201dI was the privileged son of a prominent pioneer in vascular surgery who, despite my extreme trepidation, decided to follow his father's footsteps. Now, oddly, again, I was a failure. I could have taken this as a personal failure and I could have decided to do something else, but falling back on my father's words of wisdom when I was young, I think I was just too stupid to know how dumb I was.Maybe he was right, but for some reason, I wasn't deterred. So I shrugged it off, and eventually met Dhiraj Shah, who invited me to apply to his fellowship; and I was accepted. He convinced my wife that I should skip my transplant fellowship and take a job in Albany \u201cbecause they needed a cutter,\u201d and 29\u00a0years later, I am still in Albany, New York.Now, one would have thought that my small missteps would have stopped there. But ironically, my issues didn't end there. When I applied for membership to the SVS, someone had written a note saying that I should never be considered, nor was I deserving to be a member of the SVS, and never should I be admitted into this austere Society. But with Dr Shah's support, I was accepted, and as they say, the rest is history. I am forever indebted to Dr Shah for his superb skills, leadership, and friendship. He deserves this honor and my deep gratitude as much as anyone.I mention these minor setbacks not for self-aggrandizement but more to point out that no one goes into this field because it is easy. This is our passion. This is a specialty that finds you. I tried to escape it in every way possible, but it kept drawing me back in, which is indicative of the emotional reasons we all go into vascular surgery. We look at difficult problems and challenges every day. We deal with very sick and unhealthy patients. Everyday we're asked to do the impossible, and every day we get up, go to work. We do the best we can. We can make the best plans, treat the sickest patients, and get a personal fulfillment for what we do. We do the right thing for the patient.When I was playing football, I was taught that you never give up on the play. That's what I love about vascular surgeons. We never give up on the play. We are always willing to do and try the impossible. We're always willing to be the last person to call when things look bleak. It brings me great glee whenever we get called to the OR and people look around and go, oh thank God, the vascular surgeon's here. Our colleagues in other specialties are often afraid of blood vessels, afraid of death, afraid of complications. We thrust ourselves every day into situations where nobody else will go.We put ourselves in harm's way for the benefit of our patients, taking little consideration for our time and sometimes our families. I mention this in the context of how failure is truly a bridge to success. As vascular surgeons, we face failure and roadblocks daily yet still persist where others are scared to tread. Many of you have faced far worse barriers of discrimination, unreasonable arbitrary barriers, and I am constantly humbled by your ability to overcome. This innate ability to focus on the problem is what makes vascular surgeons great. No problem is too complex; no detail is too small. We do the right thing despite the odds against us. We do right by the patient.Scientific advancement through team buildingThe extraordinary accomplishments of teams throughout human history have been well documented. One could talk about the Royal Society of London, which was formed in 1660 to promote the free exchange of ideas in promotion of \u201ctruth in scientific matters.\u201d Members included Sir Isaac Newton; Christopher Wren, the architect of St. Paul's Chapel; Gotfried Leibniz, the inventor of calculus; Edmund Halley, an astronomer; and Robert Hook, the inventor of the steam engine, just to name a few. The Society invited membership of scientists regardless of nationality or state of war they were in. The free flow of shared information between Royal Society members led directly to the industrial revolution, embryonic evolution theory, mechanical computation, an understanding of planetary gravity, and more. There is perhaps no other period of history in which science moved so far and so quickly. The level of trust (truth, respect, understanding, support, and accountability) and shared vision in the goal to advance science that the members of the Society achieved places them in the high-performance team hall of fame. This surely required extraordinary communication and planning as well as shared vision.While Helen Brooke Taussig and Alfred Blalock both won deserved fame for their efforts, another key player is still unknown to most people: Vivien Thomas. In January 1930, Vivien Thomas, a young African American, came to work for Blalock in his laboratory. At that point, Blalock's increasing obligations were cutting into the time he could spend in the laboratory and he needed a surgical assistant. Vivien Thomas learned to perform the surgical operations and chemical determinations needed for their experiments, to calculate the results, and to keep precise records. Blalock and Thomas worked closely in the surgical laboratories. Thomas was a major contributor in the development of operative techniques. Thomas supervised the surgical laboratories at Hopkins for more than 35\u00a0years, and in 1976 he was appointed instructor in surgery at The Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine. In 1979, on his retirement, he became instructor emeritus of surgery. Vivien Thomas's achievements were widely recognized by his colleagues. In 1976, he was awarded the honorary degree Doctor of Laws by The Johns Hopkins University. Without him, this lifesaving operation would not be available ().Each of these examples have common themes of broad shared vision and teams of individuals with unique talents and knowledge looking at the same problem and coming up with complementary, cross-cutting solutions. The members on all of these teams did not always like each other, but they developed a deep respect for the higher mission, each other's individual contribution, and they respected each component of the team, knowing one gap could spell failure. This is why I am so proud that the Society for Vascular Nursing has joined us in working together in this and future meetings. I'm always amazed at our nurses' dedication to education and patient care and honored to be working with them. We are also excited to have a new chapter of vascular physician assistants who will help complete the circle of clinical vascular care. Together we can work to brand our specialty and provide expert comprehensive vascular care.Leadership, partnership, and teamworkJust looking at our current-day issues facing patients with vascular disease, one must strongly consider the opportunity we have. The SVS has developed strong partnerships with the Society for Vascular Nursing, the American Venous Forum, and the Society for Vascular Ultrasound and is seeking to strengthen relationships with the regional vascular societies, the Vascular and Endovascular Surgery Society, the Society for Clinical Vascular Surgery, the Society for Vascular Medicine, the American Heart Association, and many others. The SVS is developing these relationships with the patient at the center, and with purpose, focusing on shared vision of specific advancements, programs, and initiatives that will advance quality of care. By tapping into this vast array of talent, vascular surgery will become more agile, intelligent, and thoughtful in our care of vascular patients.We look forward to working with other societies not only to strengthen our stance and our brand but also to allow us to become better, stronger, and smarter.Vascular surgery is a unique profession. We are medical doctors who perform open surgical procedures as well as minimally invasive endovascular therapies. We do diagnostics, we read ultrasounds, we read computed tomography scans; most of the patients we take care of, we take care of medically, either observationally, in follow-up, or before or after procedures. It's not to say we're the only ones that can do these procedures, but we do have the training, background, and techniques to perform extremely complicated therapies and to do so wisely. I think perhaps the most important thing we have is the wisdom and ability to know when not to intervene\u2014the ability to discuss with a patient and the patient's family the prognosis and outcome in a way that is honest and free of interference from external forces and to give patients and their families myriad options as well as help them logically come to the best conclusion for their health. We do right by the patient.Team-based health careIf we are honest with ourselves, we know there is no way any of our operations could have been performed without the combined effort, intelligence, and knowledge of the nurses and the technologists, and the results were driven by the dedication of the residents, the fellows, the floor nurses, the physician assistants, the ICU nurses, and the staff in the office. As I mentioned, the surgeons in the past paid for their own scrub nurses, they paid for their own instruments besides the basic ones given to them for general exploratory laparotomy procedures. Their scrub nurse would accompany them in the office, so they would see the patient preoperatively. They would see the patient with the surgeon intraoperatively and postoperatively. They were an integral part of the team. They had the respect and trust of the attending surgeon. They were a true team. It was extraordinary what could be accomplished when a team is functioning at a high level with good communication.When one looks at the scope of a team in health care today, it is obvious that the team extends far beyond the OR staff. When really looking at what we have to deal with today, there are many components of the team that are indispensable. Currently, each patient coming to your service touches more than 100 staff during their experience. This includes your office, vascular laboratory, angiography suite, recovery room, hospital floor, ICU, and computed tomography scanner, to name a few. Hence the evolution from \u201ccaptain\u201d to \u201cleader.\u201d As a surgeon, you're always taught that you are the captain of the ship, which still remains true, although the captain role is fast evolving to the role of leader. The captain must always rely on the navigator, the engineer, and all the components of that ship for it to work effectively and efficiently.The team concept extends beyond the environs of your hospital work and even to your family. Most of these surgeons could not have had the luxury of performing these operations without the support and sacrifices of their families. In those days, it was a very competitive environment. Surgeons' egos were given far more leeway, if you can imagine, than they are today. There was a tremendous amount of sacrifice that the wives, husbands, and significant others of these surgeons had to make to create the family team.I realized this was not much different from the organized sports I played my entire life. One thing I loved about sports was the team effort, the shared vision, and the feeling of accomplishment. Win or lose, we're a team and you either celebrate together or commiserate together.I won't bore you with data that numerous papers have written about interdisciplinary teams and how well they work. By now I'm sure you're wondering, How does this pertain to my future? For a while, medicine seemed to have drifted away from the team concept. However, as more complex procedures have been adopted, as health systems evolve, as payment systems navigate toward value and quality, more multidisciplinary clinics have emerged, so the pendulum is now swinging back and picking up significant momentum. Cardiac surgery, transcatheter aortic valve replacement teams, stroke teams, and pulmonary embolism response teams are all demonstrating the value of a cohesive, well-trained team. Future appropriateness standards and payment models may not even be considered in the future if they have not been developed and endorsed by a multidisciplinary panel ().If you have not had any formal training in leadership or team development, I strongly suggest you add this to your learning portfolio. The SVS is addressing this through its Leadership and Diversity Committee, and you will see an expanding array of learning opportunities in the future.The world around the SVS is evolving, and so the SVS is evolving as well. The guidance and insight we've received from you, our members, and our executive board have helped us identify key issues for the future and address them with consistency of thought, feeling, and communication. And we have never been in a stronger position to answer the call. The SVS staff team is led by the amazing Ken Slaw, who is working to create optimal alignment and synergy between our more than 400 volunteer members for the councils and committees of the SVS, our expert staff professionals, the SVS mission, and top priorities. I can't thank Ken, Patricia Burton, Elsa Hall, and the entire SVS staff enough for their professionalism, dedication to us as vascular surgeons, and excellent guidance they provide.The road aheadThe SVS is truly a team that is working for you. You have made it loud and clear that you want SVS not only to set the standard for clinical excellence in vascular surgery but to addressallof the key factors impacting your ability to deliver the highest quality care on a day-to-day basis.We have heard your voice encouraging SVS to take a stronger position in branding our specialty within medicine and to the public. There is no doubt. We must work together to establish and strengthen our brand. Your executive board has directed the SVS Public and Professional Outreach Committee, with an expanded membership and expanded resources, to tackle this issue aggressively in the coming year.I also believe we will not be effective or successful in this endeavor until we truly know who we are, understand our true value in clinical and economic terms (underscored by Ron Fairman last year), and are willing to set standards for quality and appropriateness (underscored by Peter Lawrence), embrace them, and live by them (underscored by Bruce Perler). SVS is moving beyond conceptualization to reality. All of this is within our reach.I am proud that during my year as President, the SVS has invested in several new task forces to address critical future issues, including alternative payment models for vascular surgery, a national inpatient and outpatient vascular certification program, and a focus on our own health and wellness and potential ways to mitigate potential burnout; Dr Makaroun will be taking on the issues of vascular surgery valuation and workforce in the new task force on the future of vascular surgery.The SVS, under the guidance of Tony Sidawy, past SVS president, close friend, consigliere, and mentor, is leading the effort to establish a vascular center certification process for both inpatient and outpatient settings, drawing from models and resources in the American College of Surgeons. This will allow each and every one of us to go to our administrators and department chairs and tell them if they would like to be certified and validated as a vascular center of excellence, these are the standards we must meet; this is the infrastructure that will allow us to achieve quality.I believe inpatient and outpatient vascular centers will want to achieve this certification based on SVS standards and developed across disciplines. Having a signature program like this will only be helpful in creating an infrastructure that values what we do as vascular surgeons and brand vascular surgery as a unique specialty. This will create a uniqueness of our specialty, let us control indications, and ensure our patients and families that their physicians were provided the adequate infrastructure to perform complex and standard interventional and open procedures.It is critical that this be done as outpatient as well as inpatient and will be used to help create data-driven decisions and data-driven outcomes that can be used to combat arbitrary third-party payers' decisions to deny reimbursement. Hopefully, we can work together with many of our brethren who perform patient procedures, that we, as a Society, will be integrally involved in creating state mandates and help to adjudicate our differences. I believe this will become the face of vascular surgery. We will be looked at as data driven, patient centered, objective, and team oriented, pushing forward to be at the forefront of decision-making, whatever changes happen in reimbursement.We must brand vascular surgeons as the \u201c21st century leaders\u201d of the vascular health care team. And we must ensure vascular surgeons, and our residents and fellows, are trained to lead teams well and stay healthy and balanced.Our own \u201cwellness\u201d is an often-overlooked component that I think added a significant amount of stress to the surgeons in eras past. The anger I saw in many of the surgeons I worked with, in retrospect, was probably a symptom of burnout from competition, from alienation, and from overwork. In those days, although they worked in their own insular teams, many of the surgeons worked independently, had very poor support systems, and didn't know how to deal with failure either personally or professionally. One of the main goals of the SVS is to work on health and wellness for the vascular surgeons, to work on providing individuals and systems support to address the triggers or causes of burnout. But first we need to identify those triggers, and that isexactlywhere our task force, under the leadership of Dawn Coleman, Malachi Sheahan, and Sam Money, has begun. We need to work toward an environment where admitting one is tired or under physical duress, admitting one needs help, and working out a system to allow one to get adequate support to lead a healthy life is an important part of delivering quality care. This is not a weakness but a strength.I know many of you are snickering out there because I may not be the poster child for moderation and personal health. I love my wife for putting up with many of my well-known sybaritic excesses, but also having lived through the singular and the communal-type system, I vowed after working as a tech in a world where there was little emotional support and seeing the stressors that I would never work in a system in which I felt isolated and unprotected. My father went for 5\u00a0years without taking a vacation, fearing that someone would steal his patients and he would lose his practice. He told me, \u201cVacation is when I operate on the patients I want to operate on, not those I have to operate on.\u201dI wanted to live in a world that was very much like playing sports. \u201cShared goals and shared vision.\u201d That's why I'm eternally grateful to my partners for their support and guidance in many of my challenging times. Ironically, as you look on your circle of teams, again, it does not extend solely to your partners, the nurses on the floor, the nurses in the ICU, the nurses in your office, and vascular laboratory techs and angiography techs. We also must consider working within systems; work with administrators, with radiology and cardiology and vascular surgery when they cross over. We work within different departments, whether you're your own department or whether you work in the department of surgery, one of the things I think we've all learned in the past is that we work better when working together rather than fighting among each other. I would strongly argue that we need to concentrate our efforts in promoting our brand, the benefits of what we do and the systems we create, as opposed to fighting against other vascular surgeons and subspecialties. We all need to come up with a solution as opposed to just complain about a problem. As Sun Tzu said, \u201cThe supreme art of war is to subdue the enemy without fighting.\u201dThis is where the SVS can help.We will have to shift our teaching from a \u201csee one, do one, teach one\u201d to a more inclusive group-oriented learning experience, similar to aviation. Simulation is not the only solution. We need to consider preprocedure briefing with the entire staff and a postprocedure debriefing/evaluation where everyone has an equal voice. This allows all to learn from each person's mistakes and develop data-driven algorithmic thinking. We have used this in the office setting as well as in the OR and in team training in preparation for emergencies.As we work to strengthen our brand, identity, and autonomy, the SVS executive board has supported and thanks Amy Reed and Will Jordan for their leadership in the Association of Program Directors in Vascular Surgery and for taking the first step toward attaining a separate Vascular Residency Review Committee. We are a unique, autonomous specialty that needs to take control of its training and future.The SVS is also working closely and collaboratively with the American Board of Surgery and the Vascular Surgery Board to complete the work that was begun a decade ago and achieve an autonomous Vascular Surgery Board that is an equal partner and stakeholder in the American Board of Surgery.Continuing leadership pathways for senior vascular surgeonsLast, I'd like to talk about the stages of a vascular surgeon. One of the grave concerns that I have seen during the past five decades of working with surgeons is the exit pathway of senior vascular surgeons.Currently I think you need 2 to 5\u00a0years of rigorous and appropriate observation in working with some supportive senior vascular surgeons in an environment that is less stressful and really dedicated to your personal and professional and technical growth. The next 10 to 15\u00a0years is when one really develops expertise technically, whether it's open or endovascular, and this is where we need to work on burnout, overwork, and emotional problems that can arise. However, the last decade of work, when senior surgeons are trying to transition to nonclinical work\u2014I think we throw away much of their intellectual skill and experience in dealing with vascular surgery problems.Vascular surgeons by nature are excellent problem solvers. We take very complex problems with very sick patients and synthesize it down to what could be the series of options and prioritize those options to what is best for the patient. There are very few specialties that have the ability to treat patients medically, surgically, or interventionally, with such severe disease and such potentially lethal outcomes if left untreated.We have thecoup d'oeil, the stroke of the eye, the ability to look over the battlefield in one glance and see the logistical advantages and disadvantage of the plan. We analyze difficult problems, weed out the extraneous details, come up with comprehensive solutions (not just one but a series of them), and then prioritize them, much like any CEO would do. Vascular surgeons are proven leaders and have all the right stuff to be even better leaders.So as our senior surgeons leave clinical practice, we need to use their intellectual expertise and experience in a more productive way. We all went into vascular surgery because we could not only solve problems intellectually but technically perform complex miracles that have outcomes that we have objectively evaluated in short term and in long term.The experience of this cohort should never be lost to our Society and should be used in advocacy and for quality practice for financial as well as appropriateness of care and guidelines, to name a few. We need to train not only our senior surgeons but those in the early and mid portions of their career in leadership skills. Not everybody may choose to have a busy clinical practice. Many may want to do basic science, may want to be actively involved in teaching, advocating, mentoring, first assisting, and administration. We need to train people to be leaders of hospitals, leaders of third-party payers, and intermediaries to those positions. We need to have a better exit strategy that does not throw away these hard-earned skills and to use their knowledge and skills for the benefit and envision what's good for vascular surgery and the future.We, as the SVS, need to establish pathways for leadership, pathways to train people in administration and work with establishing a pathway for others, such as hospital CEOs and systems, to use this wealth of experience and knowledge. Vascular surgeons do not just do vascular surgery. They administrate, they adjudicate, and most important, they can make sure the right thing gets done. We need to be involved, we need to set the standard, we need to work together with those that agree, and even those that don't, and use our ability to use data-driven logical decisions that are patient driven. They will do right by the patient. We are all driven; however, as the proverb says, we must feed the wolf that embodies good, love, hope, kindness, and truth.Your identity and role as a vascular surgeon should never end with your decision to scale back clinical work. We must find ready outlets for our members to make contributions across the spectrum of opportunity in our Society and our field.ConclusionsSo, in closing, let me briefly return to the points I made earlier about what I have learned on my own journey.I strongly believe Einstein was right when he said, \u201cNone of us is as smart as all of us.\u201d If we approach every interaction as an opportunity to learn, it is impossible not to change in some way. We learn from each other, which is the foundation of building high-performing teams. Thank God everyone else is smarter than I am because I am learning every day!The world around us is intense. The forces and pressures are immense. I cannot stress this enough. As a specialty of vascular surgery, we must hold together and be united around common vision and purpose. If we compete and pull apart, we are vulnerable. Nobody else will care about vascular surgery if it looks like vascular surgery does not care about vascular surgery! The key to our resilience, healing, and health, whether for our patients or for ourselves, is in caring and supporting each other. We need to support each other for our personal health, for our patients, and for our specialty.Failure is not an end result. In all things we do, on all fronts, we should be comfortable with pilot testing and experimenting with new models. If we create a safe environment for each other to learn and grow clinically and as leaders, the path to success will be faster and healthier.More than ever today, it is helpful to remember the past, especially the values, work ethic, and vision that shaped our great specialty, lest we forget it or have it replaced with alternative facts that become the new reality. It is true that the best predictor of future behavior is past behavior, but the future we are experiencing now is like no other! So, what we know to be true from the past is that we either continue to evolve or we will diminish. Thankfully, we have the right leadership, the right staff, the right membership, at this critical moment in time, to seize the future.We as vascular surgeons, physicians who treat vascular disease, have a tremendous opportunity. The nation is aging, diabetes is increasing, and there are not enough of us to adequately treat our patients comprehensively. We, physicians, nurses, physician assistants, technologists, staff, and administrators, need to work together, think together, grow together for our patients, for our partners, our families. We are all part of a team\u2014the vascular team. The SVS is here to work for you, to help you work through your problems, to give you access to solutions that will improve your life, your career, and most important, patient care. Use us and hold us to our promises. This is your Society. You do miracles every day. You do what people deemed impossible. Others come to you for solutions of fatal and insolvable problems. You go where everyone else is afraid. You deal with the greatest challenges and even in failure sit with the families in their time of need. You are always up to the challenge. You do the right thing for the patient. You don't back down.This is a truly amazing field with amazing and dedicated people. I am proud to say I am a vascular surgeon. We are vascular surgeons.It has been my honor to serve as your president. Thank you so much for your love, honor, and support.",
  "2019": "I am in favor of progress; it\u2019s change I don\u2019t like.\u2014Mark TwainI am deeply honored to have served as the 73rd president of the Society for Vascular Surgery (SVS). The Society stands proudly as the oldest and arguably the most prestigious of all vascular societies. I am truly humbled by your trust and confidence. This has been the apogee of my surgical career and I would like to say, Thank You.The SVS was started in 1946 by 31 founding members. It has since morphed into a vibrant multidimensional society with >6500 professionals in different membership categories, including >1000 international members.Today\u2019s SVS was born in 2003, when it merged with the American Association for Vascular Surgery, opening a Chicago office in the American College of Surgeons building, and hiring a full-time staff. This year, with nearly 40 staff members and a large portfolio of activities, we moved in February into larger headquarters near O\u2019Hare airport. The activities of the SVS have grown well beyond the Vascular Annual Meeting (VAM) and theJournal of Vascular Surgery(JVS), which added a fourth offering this year: JVS/Science. The talents, creativity, and energy of >350 volunteers, serving on >30 committees and task forces, drive the efforts of the SVS. Some highlights from previous year include a successful effort by our policy and advocacy group in limiting negative regulatory effects on your practice. The Vascular Quality Initiative has reached 565 centers. The Vascular Education and Self-Assessment Program has expanded internationally and is now offered in China and Australia-New Zealand. A new learning management system being developed will move the SVS into the world of online teaching and continuous medical education. The global guidelines for chronic limb ischemia were completed and published this month in a supplement to the JVS. SVS Connect was launched to help you communicate with your peers. A vascular center verification and quality improvement program is in its final stages of development. A branding campaign to better define vascular surgery is being launched at this year\u2019s VAM. A workgroup has been developing a valuation study to better define our specialty for our health systems. A wellness review presented at this VAM initiated an effort to address a serious issue for our members, and a paclitaxel task force was formed to help navigate the morass that came to light recently.I encourage all of you to provide feedback to the leadership and volunteer your special expertise and talent to make your Society better. Please join me in thanking the endless efforts of all our volunteers and our committee and council chairs, who have been so generous with their time and talent.As we commemorated last week the 75th anniversary of D-day, I would be remiss if I did not mention one final word of appreciation to my adoptive country, to the sacrifices of countless men and women who have defended freedom around the world, to the country that was built on ideals of freedom and justice, that all humans were created equal, that welcomed me and my family and provided us with opportunities like no other. On my behalf and those of millions of other immigrants, I say thank you.That brings me to the formal part of my address.The quote from Mark Twain: \u201cI am in favor of progress; it\u2019s change I don\u2019t like\u201d has always resonated with me. Vascular surgery and vascular surgeons have famously embraced the most profound change of any surgical specialty in the past 25\u00a0years. It came despite significant resistance and some unease, but the progress is unquestionable. It ensured our survival and transformed our specialty. Today, I will discuss more changes that are needed if we are to deal effectively with some of our current challenges in a timely fashion.Among the many challenges we face as a specialty, I believe the most critical is the inadequacy of our manpower to meet the demands and needs of the public. Vascular surgeons occupy a central role in managing vascular disease and are unique in their ability to offer the full spectrum of care: conservative management and open surgical or endovascular interventions. In our absence, patients have more limited choices and will be steered toward what is available locally. Even more critical and less publicized is the role vascular surgery plays in enabling multiple other specialties to perform their procedures safely, repairing inadvertent compromise of the vasculature during both open or percutaneous interventions.The phrase \u201cfireman of the hospital\u201d has been aptly coined to describe this role.I will start with an overview of the problem at hand, a discussion we started last year at the Stanley Crawford Issues Forum and proceed to discuss some shifts in education and health care delivery impacting manpower, describe the landscape of current vascular surgery services and finally report on the preliminary work of the SVS Taskforce started nearly 8\u00a0months ago to study these issues including potential solutions and roadblocks. The\u00a0topic clearly resonates with the SVS membership. The response to the request for volunteers to serve on the taskforce was overwhelming with more than 80 members answering the call within 48\u00a0hours.Manpower shortage overviewThe highlights of the manpower shortage are familiar to all of us: unfilled jobs, increasing demand, geographic maldistribution, and a demographic cliff of our membership. The American Medical Association Masterfile estimate of active vascular surgeons in the United States is\u00a0<3300, creating a shortage in manpower that is limiting patient access to our services. More critically, it is impeding our competitive advantage with other specialties who care for vascular disease. The manifestations are multiple.Increasing demandThe number of advertised jobs far exceeds the number of graduates. One online board listed 61 available vascular surgery jobs, another had 276 listings, and our own SVS website had 102.These numbers are from this June after the current graduating class had accepted job offers. It has been estimated that at least four advertised jobs exist for each graduating vascular surgeon. The short supply has been coupled with an increasing demand for vascular services among an increasingly older population, with more diabetes and obesity. The Affordable Care Act expansion of health care coverage also resulted in more need. Should universal health insurance ever become a reality, the demand for our services will expand even further.Limited numbersA map depicting the number of vascular surgeons per 100,000 persons across the United States is a fitting summary (A). It represents the density of vascular surgeons by state, using the American Board of Medical Specialties certification report of 2017. The estimate for the optimal vascular surgery workforce determined using the demand-based optimal ratio developed by Dr Richard Cooper from the University of Pennsylvania is 1.4/100,000 population.Nationally, we are at 70% of target and across many states we fall significantly short. Also, a significant maldistribution of our workforce exists. We are concentrated in the northeast and many populous states, including Texas, Florida, and California are well below average. With this fresh in mind, it might be appropriate to point out that our training programs are also poorly distributed (,B and C). They mirror the same distribution as our members, with a large part of the United States lacking any training centers. A wise colleague once remarked that a substantial number of trainees will settle in the same geographic area in which they trained, an important point to remember in our efforts to remedy this issue.Geographic maldistributionThere is another dimension to the uneven distribution of vascular surgeons that is far more problematic. Vascular surgeons have become more and more clustered in larger groups that are mostly in urban areas and larger hospitals. Groups of 15 to 20 or more are now commonplace; ours has 19 members. It is not clear that the phrase \u201cmanpower shortage\u201d can be truly applied at these institutions. Yet, many community hospitals in both suburban areas and smaller towns completely lack any access to vascular surgery care, even in states with seemingly adequate numbers such as Pennsylvania. Others are losing or expecting to lose retiring general surgeons trained years ago, when vascular surgery exposure was still significant and still providing vascular surgery services. Vascular patients, many of them elderly with no support mechanisms, often opt to stay locally and, in the absence of vascular surgery, are treated usually by our cardiology and radiology colleagues. No surgical options, which on occasion might provide the optimal benefit for the patient, can be entertained.The critical need is clearly not uniform. I personally reviewed >100 job listings for this address, and the serious demand is clearly in smaller communities and midsize hospitals. One is for a solo practice with a promise for coverage by general surgeons, 60 miles east of Pittsburgh. One is to restart a practice years after the last surgeon left; it offers visa support and loan repayment. The next three are in community hospitals in Toledo, Ohio, Lorain, Ohio, and Paducah, Kentucky. Hundreds of similar listings exist. Most have been posted for years and have generated little interest from our graduating trainees, mostly because of location, the lack of established volume, the lack of call coverage, and the lack of mentorship and support early in practice.It is important to note that the shortage of vascular surgeons is not new, nor is it unique to us; severe shortages affect most surgical specialties, including general surgery, the default specialty that traditionally provided some vascular surgery services in the community. The need, however, seems most acute for vascular surgery, at least according to an independent analysis by Dall et\u00a0alreported\u00a0in 2013 in Health Affairs. Some in our government are finally taking notice. A bill introduced in the senate in February of 2019 (S.348-Resident and Physician Shortage Reduction Act of 2019) promises to add 3000 new residency positions per year from 2021 to 2025, with \u22651500 going to specialties identified with shortages. Handicappers have given it a 4% chance of passing (it was reintroduced in 2021 as S-834 without any action yet).Demographic cliffThe shortage problem in vascular surgery has, unfortunately, been compounded by our demographic profile\u2014it will get worse before it gets better. Many health economists have been fretting that 32% of physicians in the United States are older than 55\u00a0years; for vascular surgery, it is 42%. This oddity is the result of our certification history, which started in 1984. Until then, most vascular surgery care was provided by general surgeons who devoted some or most of their practice to vascular surgery. I know the landscape well. I am one of those. I might be the last president of the SVS who never had formal fellowship training. I became eligible for certification because of my large vascular volume at our Veterans Affairs hospital. I took the examination in the last of the 5\u00a0years that surgeons were grandfathered into the specialty. I was not the only one. A large contingent of surgeons became certified within those 5\u00a0years and are now either retired or approaching retirement, all at the same time.Limited supply pipelineAccredited fellowships were ramping up quite slowly at first. We graduated\u00a0<60 vascular surgeons per year until the mid-1990s and did not reach 100 until 2004. Therein lies the reason for our demographic oddity. A large cohort of certified physicians followed by more of a decade with few additions. Fellowship positions reached a plateau around 2006 with \u223c115 to 120 per year since then. The integrated programs have provided new opportunities to train in vascular surgery. However, many of these have not started graduating residents yet because of the significant lag between program initiation and graduation. In the 2019 match, 66 integrated positions were offered. The narrative is simple: it has been estimated that we will add only \u223c150 to 160 vascular surgeons per year during the next 5\u00a0years. Our pipeline is simply not large enough to overcome an older retiring generation of vascular surgeons with nearly one half doing so before the age of 65. The future might bring some relief, because it is expected that the next wave of aging surgeons will be smaller, owing to the limited numbers we added between 1990 and 2004. Our membership will become younger in about a decade or two, and the attrition rate will slow down, assuming we witness the same pattern of retirement and not an accelerated one.A comparison with another country might provide a better perspective. Germany has graduated 140 to 150 vascular surgeons per year since 2015, essentially the same number we do, for a population that is 25% as large as the United States. What is even more interesting, they changed their entire surgical training program to a more pragmatic pathway that promotes early specialization. All surgical specialties start with a common 2-year trunk and use 4\u00a0years of focused training in chosen fields. The average time in training compared with the United States is reduced by 2\u00a0years and active careers are extended.Change and progressAllow me now to shift gears and leave our shortage discussion for a bit to introduce the subject of change and how we deal with it because that could affect how we perceive some of the potential solutions. Uncertainty and \u201cchange\u201d often provoke anxiety and apprehension in all of us, whether justifiable or not, made worse by the ever-accelerating pace of change and our inability to keep up.With technology leading the way, the rate of change has been increasing fast in our personal and professional lives, whether new electronic medical record systems updated almost every year or new models for practice and compensation that change as often as the weather, such as the Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act of 2015 (MACRA), the Merit-based Incentive Payment System (MIPS), and Alternative Payment Models. In the face of change, most of us will prefer to cling to what we are accustomed to. Although I have adapted in my life to more changes than I care for, I have continued to view change with a healthy dose of apprehension and sometimes dread. I bought an \u201cI-Phone X\u201d weeks ago but have yet to activate it. I am fretting right now about a new compensation model we must implement by July 1, and the retirement of our last transcriptionist at the end of the month that will force me to enter notes in Epic myself!Change does not come easy!Although most do not like change, surgeons hate it. They are notoriously steeped in tradition and resist new changes more than others. Watch the wars that erupted simply at the suggestion that we wear bouffant hats instead of the traditional surgeon caps. It resulted in funding major studies to disprove the utility of such a change.,It even made the editorial page of our \u201cVascular Specialist\u201d out this week.Understandably, not all change is progress, although all progress does require change that we often resist before realizing the benefits. Consider the electronic medical records and PACS (picture archiving and communication systems) and our initial negative reactions and how they affect our lives now. I now sign my records at home with the click of a mouse and review emergency computed tomography scans for my colleagues in the middle of the night or across oceans. There is no going back!In discussing workforce issues, we cannot ignore the major shifts, change, and uncertainty we are experiencing in health care delivery, education, and the generational change in our newest members. We will start with health care delivery.Healthcare deliveryMore than 10% of vascular surgeons now practice primarily, if not exclusively, in ambulatory facilities according to our most recent survey. You might have noticed the new office-based laboratory pavilion in our exhibit hall and the creation of a new SVS section on outpatient and office vascular care, which simply recognizes this increasing trend. This direction is gathering steam and has reduced the available pool of vascular surgeons available to accept hospital practices and cover emergencies, especially in underserved communities.Despite this movement, nearly two thirds of our members are currently employed by hospital systems that are becoming larger and larger, making it essential to navigate an ever more complex decision-making process in employment, compensation, and spectrum of activities. Practice environments are becoming more corporate and bureaucratic. The rapid expansion of our own system is a case in point. We now have 40 hospitals, with more to come, 87,000 employees, and 3.5 million enrollees in our health insurance plan. The revenues have now reached $20 billion. Administrator ranks are swelling fast nationwide, and most do not know what vascular surgeons do, yet they decide on many aspects affecting our daily lives. Educating them about the role and value that vascular surgeons bring to their institutions is clearly becoming more pressing and critical, both to make our specialty flourish and be attractive to new recruits.Parenthetically, an unexpected benefit of our expanding system, was to offer me a first-hand and deeper knowledge of a multitude of hospital settings and the realities of vascular surgery care beyond the city limits.Human capitalBefore discussing the shifts in the educational landscape, let me briefly introduce the concept of human capital. It is an established concept in economics, with several Nobel Prize winners, including Gary Becker in 1992, Theodore Schultz in 1979, and, most recently, Paul Romer in 2018, having played a significant role in defining its profound value in micro- and macroeconomics. The book by Beckeron human capital analyzed the topic with special reference to education. Human capital is defined as the collection of skills that the labor force possesses and is regarded as a resource or asset. It includes education, training, knowledge, talents, skills, and experience. The concept dates to Adam Smith,who stated in his book \u201cAn Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations\u201d that \u201cthe acquisition of talents during education, study or apprenticeship costs a real expense which is capital in a person. Those talents are part of his fortune and likewise that of society.\u201d The intersection of human capital and change as it pertains to our discussion today lies mainly in the training models we use to effectively increase our workforce and \u201ccapital\u201d intended to benefit the individual but also society in general.Education and trainingTrends in education and surgical training are affecting both of our training paradigms but more so our integrated residency. Women constituted 51.6% of medical school enrollment in 2018, with expectations for a further increase. Surgical specialties have not done enough to attract more women to their ranks. Exposure to surgery as a discipline is in decline across all schools, and most students are not exposed to vascular surgery at all. Compounding the problem is school debt, which now averages almost $200,000 per graduating student. Facing a long arduous training and many years before they can even start paying their debt, it is no wonder surgical careers appear less attractive at the outset, especially for young women already wondering how to juggle job and family demands. The attractiveness of integrated programs to our new generation is understandable but will require an investment of time and effort at the medical school level, an effort that our specialty has done well both at individual schools and at societal levels.What does the landscape look like during residency? An 80-hour work week for \u22655\u00a0years, exceeded more often than anyone cares to admit, and a 40% to 50% burnout rate. The attrition has been historically at 15% to 20% for general surgery but, to the surprise of many, much lower in the vascular integrated programs. Add to this mixture a generational change that, appropriately so, values a better work/life balance, a less frequent call schedule, and urban environments, and the result is serious shortages in both vascular and general surgeons in smaller community hospitals. It is my unconfirmed suspicion that as more of our graduates become women in the future, this established trend will become even more exaggerated.Of even more concern, general surgery programs no longer graduate true general surgeons at the rate they did. At the conclusion of 5\u00a0years, an expanding number of graduates, now nearing 85% to 90%, will choose to obtain additional specialty training. More pertinent to our discussion, the 10% to 15% who start practice as general surgeons no longer have a significant vascular exposure. However, enough evidence exists that even without formal training, these surgeons are either pressured locally or willingly engage in providing some vascular services. Many practice and hospital websites refer to them as vascular surgeons or as general and vascular surgeons. This is disturbing, because many of the general surgeon graduates do not even believe they are particularly well prepared to enter general surgery practice. This has prompted the American College of Surgeons to introduce a 1-year transition to a practice program now designated as the \u201cmastery in general surgery program\u201d at >30 sites in the United States.The problems have not gone unnoticed by those responsible for surgical education. Barbara Bass, in a thoughtful commentary, questioned the wisdom of our training model that asks all to follow a path designed for the few.I could not agree more with her statement that the objective and guiding principle should be to \u201cmatch training to practice.\u201d A blue-ribbon committee of the American Surgical Association deliberated for 2\u00a0years before submitting their report in 2004, echoing similar sentiments.The committee noted that \u201cwe must accept the reality that most surgeons will confine the scope of their practices to meet definable goals. This should lead to earlier differentiation into goal-oriented specialty tracks.\u201d They recommended the development of a modular system with similar underpinnings as the modern German model. Although many of the other recommendations are being implemented in teaching competencies, defining milestones, and developing a national curriculum, the bold, fundamental, and impactful recommendation for a modular system has languished because of the daunting prospect of the profound change its implementation would imply.Change does not come easy!Current manpower landscapeThe current landscape has a clear two tiers divided by hospital size and location. Large urban hospitals are attracting the bulk of our trainees, replacing retiring surgeons and expanding the size of the groups. These hospitals have minimal, if any, shortage. This is likely to be the case for at least another decade, if not longer, until more favorable demographics start expanding the workforce and its distribution.The most pressing concern is the inability of our specialty to provide vascular surgery services to the multitude of hospitals located in smaller communities. In those areas, patients are cared for by a coalition of the willing: interventionalists, including cardiology and radiology colleagues, whose practice does not depend solely on vascular patients, joined by recent general surgery graduates who have poor vascular training but are still pressed into service. Most patients are not referred and do not travel to major vascular centers because they are unwilling, unable, or truly believe the vascular expertise is available locally. The exception to the rule are a few isolated vascular surgeons, who brave all difficulties and establish a practice in a small community.The SVS taskforce on the future of vascular surgeryThe SVS established a task force to study our manpower issues last fall. The final report to be submitted to the executive board is not complete yet but because I chaired this task force, I would like to provide you with an update on its progress. The taskforce was divided into three workgroups to focus on multiple different solutions.Workgroup to increase training positionsThe first workgroup under the leadership of Malachi Sheehan and Jeffrey Jim focused on the obvious solution: a campaign to increase our training programs and available positions. The initial target was general surgery programs without any vascular fellowships. Although strategies to focus on regions of the United States without any current vascular training might be more impactful, it will take more time and would be addressed as a second stage.It might help to briefly review our current training paradigms as they stand to illustrate the major difficulties obstructing an effective resolution.Starting in 2007, four different pathways were available to obtain vascular surgery certification. They differed in the number of years, certifications obtained, and types of practice that graduates can choose to enter. The traditional fellowship program of 5\u00a0years of general surgery and 2\u00a0years of vascular surgery and the early specialization program of 4+2\u00a0years lead to both general and vascular surgery certification. The independent program of 3+3\u00a0years and the integrated program of 0+5\u00a0years lead only to vascular surgery board certification. The independent program never gained any traction because of the ill-advised mandate that the first 3\u00a0years must be at the same institution and under the control of the general surgery program director. The early specialization program is limited to a only handful of sites, which leaves only two legitimate tracts to increase our graduates significantly: the traditional fellowship that has been renamed \u201cindependent\u201d and the \u201cintegrated\u201d program.Increasing the number of fellowship slots seems the most efficient mechanism to increase our numbers because it can bear fruit 2\u00a0years after initiation. Unfortunately, this is only aspirational, because a reality check fails us in this effort. The pool of general surgery graduates is finite with competition from several specialties that are more analogous to modern general surgery than is vascular surgery. The ratio of applicants per available position has hovered around one for many years, and slots often remain unfilled in the matching program. In the 2019 appointment year, 16 positions remained unfilled. Lest you think this is only a recent new phenomenon, 19 positions were unfilled in the match 9\u00a0years earlier, continuing a trend for the past 15\u00a0years. It would then seem counterproductive to increase unwanted fellowship slots, because it is unlikely to result in more vascular surgeons. This is, however, not entirely accurate, because several fellowships have continued to be eliminated slowly in favor of integrated programs. Keeping enough slots available to capture all interested graduating general surgeons is important. One bright spot that might help us in this effort is the recent decision to eliminate the requirement that a vascular fellowship only exist in conjunction with a current general surgery program.Increasing the number of integrated programs is less efficient because of a minimum 5-year lag between the initiation of a new program and graduation. However, it can tap into an almost unlimited pool of applicants from medical school and, more recently, some very qualified international medical graduates. This makes it potentially a far more effective solution for the long term. Challenges to this tract, however, include the need for a larger faculty, more involvement from the\u00a0teaching staff, and, in particular, more funding for the larger number of positions. Despite poor exposure in medical school to vascular surgery, student interest is high. The ratio of U.S. allopathic seniors ranking vascular surgery first per available positions was 1.92 in 2016, the highest of any specialty in the match.In the most recent National Resident Matching Program report from the 2018 match, the honors went to the new integrated program of interventional radiology, illustrating the attractiveness of these direct pathways to medical students. A number of recruitment efforts to stimulate interest of students will need to be directed at medical schools.Undaunted by the obvious limitations, the workgroup picked up a strategy used years earlier and attempted to contact all hospitals with a general surgery program and no associated vascular fellowship. The entire taskforce helped with the telephone calls. In total, 113 contacts were made and 40 prospects identified. Help in navigating the process of securing financing and applying for a new program was offered. A session was conducted earlier today at the VAM for interested potential sites to start discussing the process. This effort is being conducted in association with the Association of Program Directors in Vascular Surgery, which has updated its guide for new programs available on our website. I hope some of you are considering developing new training programs. Help is available to you and there is no more rewarding professional activity you can engage in. (From July 2018 to July 2021, 12 new integrated programs with 19 positions and 12 new fellowships were approved, most related to this effort.)Workgroup for a vascular valuation studyThe second workgroup, under the leadership of Rick Powell and Andy Schanzer, was tasked with analyzing and understanding the entire spectrum of our clinical activities and producing a valuation study to illustrate the economic and vital effects of vascular surgery for hospitals and patients. The issues were discussed with several consulting groups, including the Advisory Board and SG2, and produced a large document that will appear in the JVS. A request for proposals was also issued to engage a consultant to produce a summary document targeting executives and administrators with the information gathered. The work of this group is essential to promote a healthier relationship between our specialty and our institutions, making vascular surgery more attractive for future recruits. (The valuation report was published in JVS in February 2021. A collaboration between SG2 and SVS produced documents intended for health systems in June 2021. A consulting collaboration with SG2 was finalized in July 2021.)New models and alternative programs for the communityThe third workgroup, under the leadership of William Jordan and Timur Sarac, had the toughest job. It was tasked with thinking outside the box and suggesting methods to address our most glaring need: the community hospitals, where most of the advertised jobs are, jobs that are being shunned by graduates of our current programs. To illustrate this significant void, I will start by offering four vignettes from different points of view. These are, by no means, isolated situations. I know of dozens more that are all very similar.First is the community hospital point of view. You might recall the presentation at the Crawford forum last year by Dr G.G., the chief medical officer of a health system in Maryland: a new 200-bed hospital serving a population of 75,000 with \u223c12,000 admissions annually, 46,000 emergency department visits, and an open heart program. Vascular surgery services were provided until 8\u00a0years ago by general surgeons who have since retired. A wide range of vascular interventions are offered by an interventional radiologist, including \u223c25 endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) procedures per year, and the cardiac surgeon participates with 50 carotid endarterectomies and 25 other miscellaneous reconstructions. Despite the successful recruitment of other specialists, including general surgeons, the hospital has failed for 8\u00a0years to attract a vascular surgeon despite an attractive salary, proven volume in the community, and strong support from the local radiologist and cardiac surgeon. The reasons for the failed recruitment are multiple and all too predictable\u2014professional isolation and a lack of call coverage lead the list, in addition to the community location and amenities. Patient care is suffering with the inability to even provide for arteriovenous fistula creation in a hospital that can place patients on ventricular assist devices. A long list of actual vascular emergencies that resulted in unsatisfactory patient outcomes have been documented, including, as an illustration, a 65-year-old patient undergoing total knee replacement under spinal anesthesia. He only complained about his ischemic extremity a couple of hours later when the spinal anesthesia had worn off. An angiogram revealed transection of the popliteal artery. The delayed transfer ultimately cost the patient his extremity and the hospital a large settlement.Second is an elective patient\u2019s perspective to avoid the impression that the need is limited to emergencies. A very healthy, thin, 62-year-old patient with 5.8-cm aneurysm was referred to the local interventionalist who performs EVAR, soon after the last general surgeon able to offer open aneurysm repair announced he was no longer accepting new patients. The hospital has 280 beds and only a 45-minute drive to a major vascular service that used to receive referrals of similar cases from the retiring general surgeon but not from the interventionalist. The patient had four renal arteries of similar size, two arising in the distal neck. These two were coiled, and 1\u00a0month later, EVAR resulted in inadvertent coverage of a third that could not be salvaged after multiple attempts. The aortic bifurcation was also quite narrow. He was transferred urgently 3\u00a0days later, and, after a hepatorenal bypass, an axillobifemoral bypass for acute graft occlusion, a groin infection, and, ultimately, open conversion, he is doing well now 12\u00a0years later after six operations to treat his aneurysm that would have been best managed with a single open tube graft had the surgical expertise been available to even offer the choice.Third is the view of a recent general surgery graduate at a community hospital. Contrary to popular belief, recent general surgery graduates have continued to offer vascular surgery services in the community, unfortunately without any additional vascular training and most hospitals will grant them vascular privileges without a vascular surgery board certificate when the need is demonstrated. You all appreciate that recent graduates of general surgery programs do not have the breadth or the depth of exposure to modern vascular surgery that an older generation did.I have known J.F. since he was a medical student. He is an outstanding surgeon who graduated in 2013 from our 7-year residency with a master\u2019s degree in education. I would trust him to operate on my family. His training included the limited usual exposure of our general surgery residents to vascular surgery, which is not extensive and at the time included no endovascular procedures. He decided to forego additional fellowship specialization and joined a multispecialty group in a town in Kentucky of 60,000 people, 107 miles from Louisville. His current volume includes 15% to 20% vascular procedures. Two of his senior partners in their early 50s, again with no dedicated vascular training, perform a lot more and provide him with support. They work in a 400-bed affiliated teaching hospital. The group performs endovascular interventions in a hybrid suite, including EVAR, but also transfer a fair number of patients with complex cases to the University of Kentucky. They do not attend vascular meetings nor are they members of vascular societies. This model might serve communities well but would be significantly improved by more formal or in-depth training in vascular surgery. J.F. and his partners have attempted repeatedly to recruit a fellowship-trained vascular surgeon to join them and failed. They have abandoned their search.The fourth and final vignette explores the plight of the isolated community vascular surgeon. Although an endangered species, they do exist. C.C. finished his training in Arkansas and stayed on the faculty for 2\u00a0years. He relocated to a town in Texas in 2003, only 37 miles from Dallas, hardly a rural location. He works in a very supportive 200-bed hospital that is a level II trauma center. He has two hybrid suites and a dedicated operating room team. His practice is 24/7 and is exhausting. He offers the full spectrum of services, including fenestrated EVAR and carotid stenting. He performs \u226480 cases monthly. He takes emergency call 15\u00a0days each month, and on other days, patients are transferred to other institutions. C.C. appreciated quickly that he needed some help. His solution was to train a local general surgeon to help him part time. The general surgeon became facile with vascular procedures and ended up moving to Maui, where he now practices vascular surgery. As the practice has grown even further, C.C. needed full-time help. He has been recruiting a full-time partner for a while. This year he interviewed eight vascular surgery trainees. None were interested in considering an every-other night call schedule or the size of the community. His experience reflects exactly what new vascular surgery graduates are trying to avoid by turning away from smaller community jobs. C.C. should be commended for his continued dedication to his community.The workgroup explored many options to provide relief to community hospitals. One of the options would be to devise strategies to encourage our current vascular surgery trainees to consider smaller communities and facilitate the process by devising mechanisms for regional collaborations, postgraduate mentorships, consultations, and, possibly, even clinical coverage to avoid the \u201cisolated vascular surgeon syndrome.\u201d This type of approach would be ideal but clearly quite difficult to implement rapidly, and its success is dependent on perhaps another generational change.It is probably more efficient to consider strategies that tap into new constituencies. One consideration to be explored further is to offer a 3-year vascular surgery training opportunity to the dozens of qualified candidates in preliminary general surgical positions unable to locate a categorical spot to finish their training. This process could be implemented by reactivating the available 3+3-year pathway without its ill-advised provisions, leading to vascular surgery board certification. However, this will take some time to establish through the Accreditation Council on Graduate Medical Education structure.The last option was briefly touched on last year during the Crawford issues forum and caused a little stir, so I will spend a little more time on it. The workgroup developed this option first, because it is most likely to succeed within a relatively short period. The outline of a proposal for a community vascular surgery training program, as a first step, has been sketched and will be part of the taskforce report submitted for review by the Executive Board of the Society. Here are the salient points.Recognizing that smaller community staffing is approaching a critical level and is a public health imperative, a solution should be a priority for the SVS because it aligns well with our mission statement to \u201cpromote vascular health\u201d and \u201cenhance the ability to provide care and serve disparate communities.\u201d A useful reminder is that our collective \u201chuman capital\u201d also belongs to our society in general.The goals of the new pathway would be to improve local vascular care in underserved communities and increase the referral of appropriate cases to vascular centers. It should provide stress relief to isolated vascular surgeons and, where none exist, plant the seeds of a better work environment for vascular surgery graduates, who might reconsider this currently undesirable career choice. In the process, this will promote the visibility and role of the SVS and ensure that vascular surgery remains involved in primary vascular care.The program is designed to tap into a new constituency that augments our workforce rapidly and avoids any interference with current training paradigms. It will offer an additional year of vascular surgery training to general surgery graduates who are already committed to a community practice, many of whom are already planning to offer vascular services anyway. The program will use the transition to practice program of the American College of Surgeons as a template. Espousing the principle of \u201cmatching training to practice,\u201d the program will individualize training but focus only on low complexity procedures, both open and endovascular and, more importantly, the clinical situations that dictate referral. To maintain quality, the program will mandate the availability of mentorship, support, and real time advice after completion of the program through a regional \u201csponsoring vascular surgery service\u201d that will also accept more complex referrals. This service will also be responsible for retrospective peer review and root cause analysis of complications. Other mandates will include continuing vascular surgery education, participation in the Vascular Quality Initiative, and membership in vascular societies. A suitable membership category could easily be provided in the SVS for graduates of this program.The program could be established rapidly, could be sponsored by the SVS rather than the American College of Surgeons, and could yield surgeons destined for the community and be field tested in the near future. It would be a need-based program that could be expanded or reduced in size according to future workforce data. This type of program might only be needed on a temporary basis until other initiatives, changing demographics, or increased output of vascular surgery training programs result in alleviation of the shortages. It would be flexible and designed around the gaps it is intended to fill. The SVS will provide the entire framework for its operation and for its contents, a review of training sites, and the conditions for continued endorsement of graduates.The net benefit of this strategy will be to provide relief of a critical need before it festers longer. It would significantly improve the quality of vascular surgery care in the community, improve patient safety, and substantially protect the brand of \u201cvascular surgery\u201d currently being improperly used. It would offer patients a choice of treatment strategies and provide a counterbalance to pure interventional approaches. The association with a sponsoring institution will facilitate and increase referrals of appropriate patients to higher levels of care at a vascular surgery center.The only danger is the misinterpretation of the intent of this program and the mischaracterization of its product as equivalent to current pathways. There should be no confusion. The suggested program graduates will not be board certified and will be performing mostly general surgery and some low complexity vascular cases in smaller communities. They will require supervision of a sort by the board-certified graduates of the current training pathways working in a regional vascular center. Instead of competing, they will actually complement our current trainees and provide an extension of their outreach, similar to small feeder regional airlines associated with a large national airline.To check the appeal of the idea among the potential target group, a survey was sent to program directors in surgery who were asked to distribute the survey to their senior general surgery residents. We were told by the Association of Program Directors in Surgery that we should expect a response rate of\u00a0<3%, but we received a response between 7% and 8%. A total of 91 residents answered the survey, and, as expected, a large majority of 87% intended to pursue further fellowship training. The respondents planning to enter practice directly were a small group, which made conclusions difficult. However, their responses are telling. More than 70% identified a community hospital as their destination, one half in rural areas. A surprising 60% were planning to perform vascular procedures without any additional training. Of those who answered the question about potential interest in the program, nearly 80% suggested they would be willing to spend 1\u00a0year acquiring additional vascular skills, and many provided contact numbers in case it would become a reality soon. All wanted to be trained in hemodialysis access, carotid endarterectomy, and superficial femoral artery angioplasty. A majority desired training in femoral endarterectomy, iliac angioplasty, and varicose vein management. Fewer than one half were interested in EVAR.The work so far on this program suggests it is feasible, will attract a new constituency, and, if properly structured, will provide much-needed help where it is needed most, while promoting regional centers, and the \u201cvascular surgery\u201d brand identity.This approach has and will provoke some doubts. Although many will welcome this proposal with open arms, including Drs G.G., J.F., and C.C., some will have some reservations and concerns, including the suggestion of ripple effects and the resurfacing of old grudges and biases, known and unknown.Change does not come easy!I am reminded at this juncture of the famous line of Benjamin Franklin: \u201cIf you fail to plan you are planning to fail.\u201d Ignoring the problem does not make it go away and, more importantly, the risk to vascular surgery is great if we abandon vascular care in smaller communities to other specialists. It has been said by Thoreau that \u201cNature abhors vacuum.\u201d We must find a way to fill the vacuum now before the reality on the ground permanently excludes our specialty from this primary level of vascular care.When the need to improve vascular surgery care in the United States became obvious in the mid-1970s, our societies once before took the bold step of initiating the process of evaluating and certifying training program through a committee known at the time as \u201cPEEC\u201d (program evaluation and endorsement committee) to regulate and accredit fellowships when the American Board of Surgery would not. This was the precursor that made the American Board of Surgery formally develop the certificates of special and added qualifications in vascular surgery. It is time for another bold step to preserve the legacy of our specialty in meeting the needs of our patients and the public. For all those with questions, please ask. For all those with concerns, please voice them, but above all, please keep an open mind!Finally, remember the famous saying of John Bergan introducing the first report of Juan Parodi about EVAR in theAnnals of Vascular Surgery: \u201cIn vascular surgery, no change for the better occurred that wise and good men have not opposed!\u201d Progress is made through change even if we do not like it!Members, colleagues, and guests, it has been a distinct honor for me to address you today as the 73rd president of the Society for Vascular Surgery. You are the \u201chuman capital\u201d of our specialty and our society. We are entrusted collectively with expanding our capital. Addressing workforce issues is essential for your future and the future of vascular surgery. Together, we can do it. You work harder than anyone for your patients and your communities. Relief is needed in more numbers, better distribution, and better appreciation of our value by institutions and the public. There are many solutions, and your support in promoting new fellowships, residencies and innovative pathways is in our collective best interest.Our aging force will ultimately become younger and hopefully will include more women and be more diverse. The younger generation is more resourceful and will dream of better solutions with newer technology. The public faces of the team to take the first ever picture of a black hole this year were remarkably young and you might also note female, in a field that excluded them in the past, even more so than did surgery.As I reflect on my career, my proudest professional achievement by far is having contributed in a small way to help train 52 amazing young men and women with 18 more in the wings to join the \u201chuman capital\u201d of vascular surgery. I know they will serve our specialty, their patients, and their communities with dedication and skill. I do know they have an open mind.I leave you with Monet\u2019s Sunrise, a tribute to hope, because hope, like change, is eternal!Thank you!",
  "2021": "Introduction and personal reflectionsThank you, President AbuRahma, for that kind introduction, and thank you all for attending the 2021 Presidential Address this morning. Today, we celebrate the history of the Society for Vascular Surgery (SVS) and anticipate the next 75\u00a0years of organized vascular surgery. And thank you to the bandColdplayfor the walk-in anthem \u2013 serving as your President this year was the \u201cAdventure of a Lifetime\u201d (the name of the song), and at this moment, I definitely can \u201cfeel my heart beating beneath my skin\u201d as they describe. But truth be told, this SVS adventure started for me decades ago, long before I was even a member.Thirty-one years ago last June, I gave my first podium presentation as a vascular surgery fellow at the combined North American Chapter of the International Society for Cardiovascular Surgery (NA-ISCVS)/SVS meeting, as the Vascular Annual Meeting was then known, in Los Angeles.The 1990 meeting hall was full of skeptically inclined surgeons \u2013 the late Dr John Porter (my Program Director at the Oregon Health Sciences University) loved nothing more than sparking controversy \u2013 and aside from the bright lights on stage, my memories are mostly of the enormity of the moment for me at the outset of my career. Metaphorically, that presentation was over in an instant, but my decades-long association with the SVS was just beginning.To get a fuller perspective, we must go back even further. Nearly 100\u00a0years ago, two contemporaneous photographs were taken \u2013 the first, of my grandfather\u2019s family in Holland, the small West Michigan town where I grew up. My grandfather, who lived to be 103, is pictured with his siblings and parents at his sister\u2019s wedding. His father was a factory worker, his mother, a cook at the local college. The second image, screen left, includes my late father-in-law among his extended family in China \u2013 much better off at the time but soon to have their world upended by war and emigration. My father-in-law, a graduate of the Yale-in-China medical school, completed residency training in the United States and subsequently built a life in this great country. In my marriage to my wife, Jocelyn Dunn, these families came together, in a uniquely American way, to the betterment of both.For the Dalman family, another generation would pass before we ventured beyond the confines of home. My father was the first in his family, whose American journey stretched back to before the Civil War, to leave Holland in pursuit of an education. My mother, from Detroit, Michigan, was a first generation American herself. My parents met and fell in love in graduate school at the University of Michigan.My father is an attorney, my mother a public servant elected to several terms of office in the State of Michigan. My younger siblings Rick, an anesthesiologist, and Kristina, an attorney, both now have families of their own. We were not wealthy growing up, but our parents prepared us well for the challenges and opportunities of life beyond Holland. Thank you, Mom and Dad, who are both here with us today, for your love and support.Our children, Jessie and Jackson, have brought great joy and meaning to our lives, and we are grateful that they could both also be here today. Jessie, starting medical school at the University of Michigan, and Jackson, working for the Federal Trade Commission in Washington D.C., are making their own way in life, and we could not be prouder of you both. Thank you for coming and sharing this moment with your mother and I.Completing medical school at the University of Michigan myself, and surgical residency and fellowship training in Seattle and Portland, respectively, made vascular surgery as a career choice seem almost preordained for me. Drs James C. (Jim) Stanley, Gerald (Gerry) Zelenock, Kaj Johansen, D. Eugene (Gene) Strandness, Alexander (Alec) Clowes, John M. Porter, Lloyd M. Taylor Jr, and colleagues modeled for me what an academic vascular surgeon could be, but just as importantly, the students and residents I trained with and learned from, many leaders now in their own domains, taught me the fundamentals of surgery as they existed in the 1980s. They are far too many to acknowledge individually, but our shared experiences continue to guide me every day, and to all who helped along the way, thank you.Aside from family, mentors, and friends, my three decades living and working in Silicon Valley have provided me with the next greatest asset \u2013 a stimulating environment to nurture my career. With Dr Michael (Mike) Dake and colleagues, in 2017, we celebrated the 25th Anniversary celebration of the first domestic aortic endograft implantation, which was performed at Stanford.Working with and learning from Mike and Past SVS Presidents Drs Thomas (Tom) Fogarty and Christopher (Chris) Zarins, as well as so many other outstanding clinicians and innovators, has been an exhilarating and career-defining experience for me.Stanford University and the SVS have been entwined since the beginning; Charter member and long-time Chair of Surgery, Dr. Emile Holman, was the third President of the SVS, and pioneering cardiac surgeon and subsequent Chair of Surgery Frank Gerbode was the 12th. Following Drs Fogarty and Zarins, I\u2019m the fifth SVS President with career ties to Stanford, the 75th SVS President overall \u2013 underscoring three-quarters of a century of collaboration between the SVS and Stanford to create, nurture, and sustain the specialty of vascular surgery.It has been my great privilege to train 37 vascular residents and fellows, 27 for whom I served as Program Director or Division Chief. Apart from the tragic loss of Dr Wessam Al-Khatib to cancer nearly a decade ago, I\u2019m proud that our program graduates continue to contribute significantly to our specialty and the health of our nation. Thanks as well to the many research colleagues I\u2019ve worked with at Stanford, including bioengineer Dr Charles (Charley) Taylor and discovery scientist Dr Phil Tsao, the latter of whom is also this year\u2019s Clowes Speaker for the Vascular Research Initiatives Conference. In my own lab, Baohui Xu, MD, PhD, and successive postdocs under his supervision have worked to shed light on the fundamental mechanisms of aortic aneurysmal degeneration. Thank you all for your trust and collaborative energy in our work together.Stanford University\u2019s history and culture serve both to inspire and occasionally intimidate. Try as I might, it\u2019s not likely that the President of the United States will recognize my professional accomplishments with the Presidential Medal of Innovation, as Barack Obama did for Tom Fogarty in 2014, but who among us would not be inspired by the example? (). Thank you, Stanford.And most importantly, thank you to my bride, best friend, and confidant, Dr Jocelyn Dunn, a Harvard Medical School graduate, accomplished surgeon, and community health leader in her own right. Jocelyn, you are more lovely and fun-loving than the day we met. Throughout our life together, your support and commitment have never wavered. Today is a big day for us both. We have so much to look forward to, I can\u2019t wait for what comes next.The Society for the specialtyThank you for those indulgences, now on to today\u2019s presentation: \u201cFinding our voice, ensuring our future.\u201dOn our 75th Anniversary, we celebrate anew the vision and commitment that brought us to this point in our history. The SVS, the world\u2019s first professional society dedicated to the care of patients with vascular disease, was the vision of Dr J. Ross Veal of New Orleans and later, Washington D.C. At Veal\u2019s urging, a group of general surgeons met to discuss the concept at the Southern Surgical in 1945. The initial, organizational SVS meeting was held the day prior to the annual meeting of the American Medical Association in San Francisco in 1946, and the first clinical meeting the subsequent year in Atlantic City.The SVS was founded by 31 \u201cCharter\u201d members. Of these, a core group including (in alphabetical order) Drs Michael DeBakey, Geza De Takats, Daniel Elkin, Norman Freeman, Emile Holman, John Homans, Robert Linton, Alton Oschner, and Veal coined the name \u201cSociety for Vascular Surgery\u201d, recognizing the need for improved vascular surgical skills, procedures, and instrumentation. Ochsner, Holman, de Takats, and Veal were elected the first President, VP, Recorder, and Secretary, respectively. By 1951, with attendance and enthusiasm steadily building, more than 800 physicians attended the first combined NA-ISCVS and SVS meetings back in Atlantic City.The early history of the SVS has been celebrated previously, including at the 50th anniversary meeting in 1996. The late Harris Schumacker, the last surviving Charter Member, chronicled the proceedings of the first nearly 40 SVS meetings in his memoir, \u201cThe Society for Vascular Surgery: A History 1945 to 1983,\u201dand Andrew Dale contributed his retrospective, \u201cBand of Brothers,\u201d in 1996.Intriguingly, the Schumacker and Dale books are currently listing for $400 and $1000, respectively, on. For more background on the history of the SVS, additional resources are available (for free!) at our website,.Vision and commitment were needed to launch a professional society dedicated to an entirely new medical specialty 75\u00a0years ago. But just as our nation has changed tremendously in the ensuing decades, so too has our SVS and the specialty it created. We owe Dr James YST (Jimmy) Yao a great debt of gratitude for his many contributions to vascular surgery, but in this context, for his stewardship of its history and foundational elements. Jimmy segments our past into decades of accomplishment,as summarized and extended here:The first decade (1947-1956) \u2013 the breakthrough decade with the introduction of arterial reconstructive surgery; the second\u00a0decade (1957-1966) \u2013 growth of operative procedures and the introduction of selective arteriography and prosthetic grafts \u2013 SVS establishes its first guidelines committee \u2013Committee for the Study of Prosthetic Grafts- and in his landmark presentation to the American Surgical Association in 1965, SVS member Emerick Szilagyi and colleagues demonstrate that, based on their 15-year experience, \u201cRemoval of an abdominal aortic aneurysm was found approximately to double the patient\u2019s life expectancy\u201d; The third decade (1967-1976) \u2013 the development and application of noninvasive vascular imaging; The fourth decade (1977-1986) \u2013 the establishment of vascular board certification and widespread adoption of vascular fellowship training, the launch of theJournal of Vascular Surgeryand the Lifeline Foundation, and the initiation of the SVS/National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute\u2019s co-sponsored training grants for vascular surgeon scientists; The fifth decade (1987-1996) \u2013 rapid evolution and improvement of endovascular technology; The sixth decade (1997-2006) \u2013 the merger of the SVS and the American Association for Vascular Surgery (AAVS; formerly NA-ISCVS), evolution of the SVS to a member services organization, the rise of multi-disciplinary (as opposed to specialty-specific) professional societies, and endovascular \u201cretraining\u201d for veteran surgeons; The seventh decade (2007-2016) \u2013 rapid transition to outpatient treatment and heightened quality and outcome focus\u00a0in concert with development of the SVS Patient Safety Organization and the Vascular Quality Initiative (VQI).And now, in 2021 \u2013 looking forward another 75\u00a0years, who and what will define this time, our time?The changing face of vascular surgeryRepresentative images like my 1980s University of Washington Surgical Residency composites, the 1994 composite of the SVS Executive Board (EB) (with Fogarty as president), and early 2000s composites of Stanford Vascular Surgery annotate our past. In these photographs, nearly all the subjects are white (whether dressed in lab coats or not!) and nearly all are male, with a remarkable consistency across the decades. As we all know, who we increasingly are (and will be) looks a whole lot different than who we have been.The Census Bureau now projects that minorities together will constitute the majority of the US population by 2042.These changes are being driven both by immigration and existing population demographics, with inexorable impacts on the regional ethnic and racial make-up of America. The results are apparent already here in California, where one-third of adult residents were born outside of the United States.Developing a representative health care workforce now will help us better prepare for this future. Dr\u00a0Hannah Valantine, a transplant cardiologist and faculty colleague at Stanford, recently completed her term as Chief Officer for Scientific Workforce Diversity at the National Institutes of Health. To summarize her perspective from this experience: the health of underrepresented minorities is optimized when physicians from concordant backgrounds (underrepresented in medicine, or URiM) are involved in their care.This message was reinforced recently regarding COVID-19 vaccination by SVS Member Dr Lee Kirksey and colleagues from the Cleveland Clinic.And the vascular workforce, and SVS by extension, is evolving as well. Data from this year\u2019s SVS member census underscores this point. As of 2021, more than 50% of our members are younger than 50\u00a0years of age, and 23% are women (). This percentage compares favorably with women as a fraction of the surgical workforce overall, based on data from the American College of Surgeons. The convergence of youth, gender, and ethnic diversity in our specialty is especially apparent in recent years. More than one-third of SVS members younger than 30 are women, as compared with 3% in my age group, and more than a third are URiM regardless of age ().As a nation and as a professional medical association, we have been through a lot this year. But we\u2019ve learned a lot as well. As Kim Brooks wrote in the New York Times, \u201cPandemics make visible what\u2019s been hidden.\u201dDr Samuel Kountz was a pioneering vascular and kidney transplant surgeon in the 1960s and 1970s. Dr. Kountz accomplished many firsts, but for our purposes today, he appears to have been the first Black surgeon to present his research before the Society for Vascular Surgery, at the 16th annual meeting, held in June 1962 in Chicago.,His mentor and co-author for that presentation was Dr Roy Cohn, the inaugural holder of my endowed chair at Stanford University, the Chidester Chair.Dr Kountz presented and published extensively in the early 1960s on aortic and visceral surgery and indirect methods of blood flow measurement. These were still the formative years of vascular surgery; the annual meeting featured presentations ranging from the natural history of arteriovenous fistulae to surgical prevention of pulmonary embolism to progress in the safety and applicability of cardiopulmonary bypass. Suffice to say, in an era of surgical giants, Kountz was a prolific contributor.In 1967, Kountz was recruited to the University of California San Francisco as Chief of Kidney Transplantation, and with colleagues Drs. John Najarian and Folkert Belzer, built the University of California San Francisco into the nation\u2019s leader in renal transplantation. By the early 1970s, Kountz had personally performed 25% of all kidney transplants completed up to that time in the United States.After being recruited to the State University of New York Downstate Health System as Chair of Surgery in 1972, Kountz suffered a debilitating stroke and died in 1981, at age\u00a051.Intrigued by vascular surgery and vascular disease management as evidenced by his early investigations, Kountz\u2019s career developed in another direction. I\u2019m embarrassed to say that the records of the SVS don\u2019t tell us who was the first Black member, but it wasn\u2019t Dr. Samuel Kountz, because he never joined. Or more likely, was never asked to join, as far as we can tell at this point, as membership was by invitation in the early years. By failing to encourage and include talents like Kountz\u2019s, how many others\u2019 contributions have been overlooked or lost, to the detriment of our Society, our patients, our history?The historical record is somewhat more complete, but only slightly more satisfactory, when it comes to women in vascular surgery. Dr Helen Taussig was the first woman to present at an SVS meeting, in 1950 \u2013 the title of her presentation: \u201cDifferential diagnosis of cyanotic malformations amenable to surgery.\u201d She attended and spoke at the invitation of Charter Member Dr Alfred (Al) Blalock.By 1983, still a very selective organization, the SVS had 489 male members and one female member, Dr Nina Starr Braunwald. Dr Braunwald was a spectacularly talented and pioneering cardiothoracic surgeon, implanting the world\u2019s first prosthetic mitral valve, of her own design, at the National Institutes of Health Medical Center in Bethesda at the age of 32 in\u00a01960.It took 40\u00a0years following the founding of the SVS for female vascular surgeons to become members: Drs Nancy Cantelmo and Linda Graham both joined in 1986. The first female member of the NA-ISCVS (later AAVS), Dr Sally S. Mattingly, joined that organization in 1981. By the time of the merger of the SVS and AAVS 20\u00a0years further on, there were 27 active female vascular surgeon members in the combined organization(s), including 12 in the SVS. Those pioneers included Drs Colleen M. Brophy, Nancy L. Cantelmo, Dolores F. Cikrit, Julie A. Freischlag, Vivian Gahtan, Linda M. Graham, Elizabeth B. Harrington, Lois A. Killewich, Joann M. Lohr, Linda M. Reilly, Caron B. Rockman, and Cynthia K. (Cinny) Shortell. In 2013, when Dr Freischlag became the first female SVS President, women accounted for approximately 8% of the organization\u2019s membership.During my Presidential year, I received plenty of feedback regarding the state of the SVS and the perceived value of membership to our rapidly diversifying vascular surgical workforce. And the concerns expressed by many are valid: recognition and leadership opportunities for younger members, underrepresented minorities, and women in the SVS have, until recently, been elusive. This may partly be due to relative under-representation, especially at more senior career levels, but problematic social factors and cultural norms need also to be acknowledged and addressed. Central among these social factors is the persistent perception that leadership abilities are differentiated on the basis of gender and race. This perception leads to so-called insecurities in women and minorities as they progress in their careers, also known as the \u201cImposter Syndrome.\u201dYounger women commonly receive professional encouragement from senior colleagues at the outset of their careers. As they advance, such intentional support often diminishes, spawning initiatives to promote mentoring opportunities, negotiation tactics, effective communication styles, and leadership training for mid-career women. So is the Imposter Syndrome a real hurdle for women, or just a euphemism for the bias and sexism that make their professional journeys more difficult? Dr Jan Heemstra, Professor of Chemistry at Emory University, succinctly summarized this situation recently on Twitter (2/11/2021): \u201cI look forward to a day when discussions around being a woman in science are less about dealing with bias, harassment, bullying, sexism, self-doubt, invisible work, etc, and are more about discussing\u2026 science.\u201dA reciprocal phenomenon is the perception that men, by their nature and cultural acclimation, make better leaders. The Harvard Business Review highlighted this form of implicit bias in their article \u2013 \u201cWhy do so many incompetent men become leaders?\u201d, emphasizing the fact that, with aspiring male leaders particularly, confidence is often confused for competence, undermining organizational performance.Science and medicine rely heavily on precedent and hierarchy. The convergence of female gender and youth in medicine more broadly contributed to the enormous social media response to the \u201cProfessionalism\u201d manuscript retracted from theJournal of Vascular Surgeryin 2020.,On Twitter, more than fifty thousand Tweets, including the now iconic #MedBikini, took exception to the \u201cunprofessional\u201d behavior implied by this manuscript in the year following its publication. Clearly, we still have a way to go in helping minorities, lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBTQ), women, and younger members feel welcomed and valued as both colleagues and leaders in our profession and professional society.Cultural barriers may also prevent us from recognizing and leveraging talent in a changing society. Whereas we often look for \u201cpassion\u201d in applicants as a predictor of future career success, Dr Hazel R. Markus and colleagues, writing in theProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, identified passion, or a perceived lack of it, as a \u201cblind spot\u201d in assessing ability and potential.Analyzing data from over 1.2 million students in 59 countries taking the International Student Assessment Exam, Markus\u2019 team used student\u2019s self-assessment of their interest in science, reading, and math to gauge their level of passion. Western, industrialized nations see the self as independent and the optimal source of motivation. Collectivist societies, on the other hand, see the self as inter-dependent, part of a web of relations, roles, and responsibilities.According to Markus, the individualistic model of motivation, although more familiar to Western culture, is not objectively better. In many alternative cultures, interdependent forms of motivation effectively enable empowerment, persistence, and resilience. Commenting on Markus\u2019 findings, Dr Geoffrey Cohn, Professor of Education and Psychology at Stanford, stated: \u201cWe will be better able to unlock the potential of our students and our workforce if we have a broader and more enriched understanding of what drives people to succeed from a wider range of backgrounds.\u201dIn her provocatively titled essay, \u201cWhose culture has capital?\u201d, Dr Tara J. Yosso, Professor of Education at the University of California, pointed out that skills inherent to immigrant communities, specifically aspirational, linguistic, familial, social, and navigational talents, as well as resilience, compromise a reservoir of cultural wealth that can predict and enable personal and professional success in individuals from a wide range of \u201cnon-traditional\u201d backgrounds.Finite disappointment vs infinite hopeAs we have learned from these examples and so many more, surgical skill, courage, compassion, and commitment to the patient are not gendered, racially or culturally differentiated traits. When URiM minorities, women, and LGBTQ SVS members are met with disappointment and career frustrations, unless evaluation, appointment and promotional processes are fair and fully transparent, suspicions may arise as to which considerations determined their fate. Was the opportunity they sought \u201cnot a good fit,\u201d in the current parlance, or did ethnic, gender, racial, or sexual orientation considerations (aka illegal discrimination) influence the outcome? In his final book entitled \u201cWhere do we go from here: Chaos or Community?\u201d (Beacon Press, 1967), Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. wrote, \u201cOne of the most agonizing problems of human experience is how to deal with disappointment. These reactions poison the soul and scar the personality\u2026 The only healthy answer lies in one\u2019s honest recognition of disappointment while still clinging to hope, one\u2019s acceptance of finite disappointment even while embracing infinite hope.\u201dLike all of us, I\u2019ve experienced both failures and successes in my career. A few years ago I was privileged to be interviewed for the position of Chairman of our Department of Surgery. Having served as a faculty member my entire career, I was gratified to be considered a candidate. When someone else was ultimately selected, I was disappointed. From my perspective, I was qualified and prepared for the role. But my interpretation of the process and priorities were only part of the larger picture. The Dean of the School of Medicine chose our next Chair according to his interpretation of the role, and ultimately, he chose well.In the ensuing years, Dr Mary Hawn, the Emile Holman Professor and Chair of the Department of Surgery, has proven herself to be a capable and visionary leader, an excellent Chair by any metric of assessment. And I\u2019ve moved on to additional opportunities, including the ability to stand before you today as your Immediate Past President. So while I recognize and acknowledge the considerable privilege I enjoy as a heterosexual white male professional American in the early 21st Century, I too have some experiential basis for accepting finite disappointment while embracing infinite hope. We are all advantaged when we draw from the widest possible range of available talent to meet the challenges of the moment \u2013 at Stanford, in the SVS, and in the larger world around us. For the health of our patients and the future of our organization, we must embrace inclusivity and equity at every opportunity, even when precedent and self-consideration might suggest otherwise.Progress on the SVS strategic planVascular surgeons, both individually and collectively, represent an unparalleled force for good. Preventing strokes, amputations, premature death \u2013 we may be a small specialty numerically, but we are mighty: to paraphrase Winston Churchill, rarely in the course of history have so many received so much benefit from so few. Your SVS leadership is working hard to make our organization worthy of the specialty we serve. Substantial progress has been made in all six domains of the SVS strategic plan this year.In the Quality Domain, led by Council Chair Dr Larry W. Kraiss and Group Leader Dr Karen Woo, work on the Claudication Acceptable Use Criteria is establishing benchmark indications for intervention in this controversial area. In the past 2\u00a0years, we\u2019ve published 10 separate clinical practice guidelines, we launched the Vascular Center Verification and Quality Improvement Program beta test sites, and we acquired the American College of Cardiology Peripheral Vascular Disease Registry and integrated it into the SVS VQI, adding over 170 new sites to VQI in the process.In Research, led by Council Chair Dr Edith Tzeng and Basic and Translational Research Committee Chair Dr Luke P. Brewster, we, along with the larger surgical community, convinced the National Institutes of Health to reduce surgeon\u2019s required effort on K awards to 50% full-time equivalent, making this critical funding mechanism more realistic for our early career investigators. And looking forward, we are updating our research priorities for a new decade of discovery. Common to nearly all these new priorities are an enhanced focus on patient-centered approaches, shared decision-making, and precision medicine. Thank you to Dr Tzeng and the Research Council for compiling this benchmark assessment.In Advocacy, led by Council Chair Dr Matthew J. Sideman and Government Relations Committee Chair Dr Margaret C. (Megan) Tracci, we joined the American College of Surgeons Surgical Care Coalition to achieve relief for vascular surgeons from surgical reimbursement revaluation this past January. In the process, we garnered over $180,000 in SVS Political Action Committee contributions and sent 2700 letters to Members of Congress from 450 individual members, a record response for any SVS advocacy initiative. Please continue to support the Political Action Committee this year as we address further updates to the Medicare fee schedule.In Education, led by Council Chair Dr Rabih A. Chaer and Education Committee Chair Dr Kellie R. Brown, we launched our online Learning Management System, graduated the first class of our own Leadership Development Program, and transitioned our educational joint venture with the University of California Los Angeles to a new and more inclusive collaboration under the leadership of SVS Course Co-Directors Drs Audra A. Duncan and David A. Rigberg. Most importantly, the Education Council and its affiliated Committees deserve our thanks for working tirelessly for months to make this in-person Vascular Annual Meeting a reality. This year, more than ever before, it took a village and then some to make this meeting happen.In Practice Management and Support, led by Council Chair Dr William P. Schutze, we created a new task force on population health and transitioned the Community Practice Committee, led by Dr Daniel T. McDevitt, into a Section to increase the visibility, voice, and engagement of this important SVS constituency in leadership activities.Despite this overall progress, it should come as no surprise that the final strategic domain, Organizational Health, presented special challenges this year. Given the symbiotic relationship between vascular surgery and the SVS, this becomes an existential consideration. Quite simply, we cannot grow and thrive as a specialty without a healthy and vibrant SVS.Incoherence, according to Dr. Thomas J. Nasca of the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education, is one of the five \u201cI\u201ds of the COVID-19 pandemic, along with inequality, intolerance, incivility, and inhumanity. As COVID upended life in early spring of 2020, we moved quickly to update, coordinate, and \u201ccohere\u201d member communications. Under the leadership of SVS Secretary Dr Amy Reed, SVS Communications now speaks clearly, with one voice, on issues of importance to members, their patients, and society at large. The bidirectional nature of many of these initiatives, including the SVS Town Hall Series, Connect, and the Tweet Chats have helped us keep abreast of member concerns and feedback. We all owe Secretary Reed, and all our volunteers involved in this initiative, our thanks for their contributions to the successful evolution of our communications enterprise.For our Journals, this year we significantly expanded and diversified their editorial teams. Dr Ulka Sachdev-Ost joined theJournal of Vascular Surgeryas Associate Editor to oversee Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) efforts at the leadership level. TheSpecialistexpanded its range and impact in our new partnership with BIBA Medical Publishing Group. And theAudible BleedingPodcast joined the SVS portfolio of publishing ventures, further broadening the message and audience for SVS Communications. Currently, 2000Audible Bleedingrecordings are being downloaded each month. Across our social media portals, engagement increased dramatically, with none more important than the nearly 1000 new followers for @FutureVascSurgn on Twitter. Our #SVSTweetChat during May 2021, focused on radial artery access for vascular surgeons, received more than 360,000 Twitter impressions.The launch of the SVS Branding Campaign, in the fall of 2020, led by Dr Joseph L. Mills in partnership with Springboard Communications, is increasing the visibility of the specialty, as well as individual member practices nationwide. And the recently published Valuation Task Force report led by Dr Richard J. Powell, with data compiled in partnership with SG2, tells the rest of the health care universe what we already know \u2013 the nation\u2019s health depends on us. Together, these initiatives are revolutionizing the way the way SVS communicates with and supports its membership.Towards a more inclusive SVSYour SVS strives to be worthy of the specialty we serve. Despite everything we have accomplished, we can and must do better. We must minimize bias, implicit or otherwise, in the workings and processes of the SVS. In one of 2020\u2019s most highly cited business articles, Robert Livingston, writing in the Harvard Business Review, outlined a five-step plan for maximizing organizational equity and inclusion, starting with Problem Awareness, followed by Root Cause Analysis, Empathy, Strategy and Sacrifice, summarized by the acronym \u201cPRESS.\u201d By commissioning and ultimately embracing the final report of the DEI Taskforce last summer, we are PRESS-ing for change.To paraphrase Livingston, \u201cinclusive workplaces function as multivitamins, enabling everyone to reach their maximum career potential.\u201d In striving to be that organization for our members, this past March, we committed to achieving all the objectives highlighted by the Diversity Task Force led by Drs Bernadette Aulivola and John F. Eidt. Our implementation plan identifies the SVS unit responsible for effecting change and the expected timeframe for each DEI objective. We are already making good progress. To summarize a few of the key objectives:1.The DEI Committee was commissioned as an element of SVS governance structure. Chaired by Dr Vincent L. Rowe, this Committee is already contributing substantially to the work of the SVS. Thank you, Dr Rowe, for your leadership in this important undertaking.2.The SVS Executive Board created a diversity position statement and updated our Mission Statement, Core Values, and Bylaws to reflect these priorities.3.The SVS is developing DEI educational resources for SVS members, including implicit bias training for leaders throughout the organization.4.The first-ever Member Census was designed, administered, and analyzed to develop metrics to track DEI progress across multiple domains annually. Because we cannot improve what we cannot measure, this year\u2019s benchmark census will prove invaluable in the years going forward in helping us meet our goals. Thank you to the over 700 members who completed the inaugural census.In fact, progress is being made on every priority outlined in the DEI report. Perhaps most representative is the recent evolution of our Appointments Committee process. Appointments to SVS Committees, Councils, and Task Forces are made by the Appointments Committee, EB, or both. Participation opportunities center on appointment to one of our 30 standing committees. Council membership is comprised of committee chair positions. Task Forces are created for specific objectives within a limited time frame, usually a year or less. Writing groups and subcommittees are usually tasked with specific responsibilities from within their respective committees. Some committees, like Finance, Audit, and DEI, exist at a governance level outside the Council Framework. Sections, a relatively new addition, also exist outside the traditional Council Framework. Finally, additional opportunities exist in either special projects or liaison responsibilities with other specialty societies on behalf of the SVS EB.Traditionally, the Appointments Committee consisted of the presidential line (President, President-elect, and Vice President) and our SVS support staff. Over the past 3\u00a0years, we have expanded this to include representation from the Young Surgeons, DEI, and Community Practice Committees. Equally important is the expanded background and interest statements we request from volunteers and, starting this year, the limit of no more than two committee assignments allowed per member.Currently, 535 volunteer positions exist within SVS. In the 2020 to 2021 application cycle, 237 members volunteered for 164 open positions, resulting in a 63% rate of successful committee appointment. Among current appointees, nearly 30% are female. By race and ethnicity, 15% are Asian, 6% Hispanic, and 4% Black. These percentages compare favorably with our membership demographic of 23% female and 14% Asian, 6% Hispanic, and 2% Black (). Our growing diversity is equally well represented in Committee and Council Leadership; regarding gender specifically, 33% of Chair positions are held by women (). And these proportions did not change drastically this year, but rather represent the steady progress of intentional change over the past several years.Reflecting our efforts to lower barriers to participation, fully 52% of the 149 who received an appointment this year were not appointed to any committee last year \u2013 and nearly 40% had not been appointed to any SVS committee in the last 5\u00a0years, if ever (). This year\u2019s Appointments Report, while encouraging, is a work in progress. Of those who were not appointed this year (88 in total), no specific minority group or gender were disproportionately represented. And as was implemented last year, those not appointed to committees this year will be given priority in the next application cycle. In summary, regardless of your tenure with SVS or practice type or location or gender identity or ethnic or racial background \u2013 if your interest or expertise will help us advance our many missions, please volunteer \u2013 your application is valued, welcome, and will be given full consideration in our revised and inclusive process.Inclusion and equity go beyond being appointed to a committee or a discussion panel: inclusion and equity imply real responsibility for projects and processes of significance, with sufficient training, preparation, and resources to ensure success. A frequently cited DEI meme refers to the practice of major orchestras employing blinded auditions to advance inclusion and equity in their ranks. In this scenario, musicians perform behind an opaque screen to minimize the impact of appearance, racial, or gender bias on the selection process.In practice, however, as noted by Anthony Tommasini writing in the New York Times in the summer of 2020, blinded auditions, while improving opportunities for women, have failed in most other DEI metrics.In referencing the New York Philharmonic specifically, just one of 106 current full-time players is Black - the same number as was present in 1969 when two Black musicians sued the organization for exclusion on the basis of race. As highlighted in the article, the skill required to even be invited to audition for major orchestra membership at this level nearly always ensures success for those ultimately selected. For the success and sustainability of competitive organizations like major orchestras, diversity, in addition to skill and professional commitment, needs to be an intentional consideration.To that end, the SVS is leveraging allyship, mentorship, stewardship, skills training, and opportunity for every member, at every stage of their career, to reach their full potential in our organization. This year, we created and launched our Leadership Training program, with direction from the Leadership Committee, and chaired by Dr Melissa Kirkwood, to prepare the next generation for their opportunity. As recently summarized by former commercial airline pilot Captain Chesley \u201cSully\u201d Sullenberger, \u201cHope should not come from wishful thinking, it should come from having actual capabilities based on real knowledge and skills,\u201d which is even more true in surgery than in aviation. With educational and career development opportunities like our new leadership program, we are providing the means for members to embrace Dr King\u2019s vision of hope, based on real knowledge and skills, conquering disappointment.Membership is the lifeblood of the SVSSeventy-seven percent of board-certified vascular surgeons are SVS members. Of those who are not, the majority are in their first 10\u00a0years of practice. Some young surgeons, when asked about why they are not pursuing membership, express ambivalence about the SVS, with comments like \u201cIt\u2019s an old-boys club\u201d; \u201cI don\u2019t see anyone in leadership who looks like me\u201d; and \u201ctheir priorities are not aligned with my priorities\u201d. One senior SVS member told me recently he was discouraging his medical student daughter from considering a career in vascular surgery, let\u00a0alone joining the SVS, in the aftermath of the #MedBikini professionalism controversy. To avoid irrelevance and decline, we simply cannot be perceived as being \u201cthat\u201d society, particularly by those who we want to recruit or those who should know us best.Just as diversity and inclusion vaccinate us against implicit bias in our publishing ventures, so too are youthful perspective, ambition and lived experience the keys to relevance and sustainability for the SVS. To that end, we are advancing plans to create a Young Surgeons Section (YSS) within the SVS, limited to members in their first 10\u00a0years in practice. YSS goals include developing and maintaining a network of resources for young surgeons, including guidance on job searches, contract negotiation, how to advance in local, regional, and national leadership, and assistance in personal and professional development.Based on current demographics and our training pipeline, the YSS could include up to 1000 members.The YSS, as proposed, would subsume the existing Young Surgeons Committee and its leadership structure at the outset, including the current Chair Dr Venita Chandra, and be housed outside of a specific Council per Section norms. Dr Chelsea A. Dorsey of the University of Chicago is the proposed new section leader. Close relations are envisioned between the Clinical Practice and Education Councils and many of their respective committees. Beyond the SVS, we envision the Young Surgeons Section working synergistically with like-minded organizations including the Association of Program Directors in Vascular Surgery, the Society for Clinical Vascular Surgery, the Vascular and Endovascular Surgery Society, Rouleaux Club, and the regional vascular societies to achieve common goals. Reflecting their importance within the SVS, Section leadership will meet with the SVS EB regularly and nominate representatives to the SVS Strategic Board and Appointments Committees.To summarize, the SVS is working hard to become the fully inclusive and equitable Society our members need us to be. These initiatives will not, and were not intended to, re-write history, or convey \u201cvirtue signaling,\u201d but rather to ensure that the SVS remains a viable and effective force for good far into the future.The next 75\u00a0years of the SVSTo circle back once again to the title of Dr King\u2019s last book \u2013 where do we go from here? As Amanda Gorman so eloquently noted during the inauguration of United States President Joseph Biden in January 2021: \u201cWhile we have our eyes on the future, history has its eyes on us.\u201dThe world\u2019s first telegraph message anticipated the dawn of the Information Age: \u201dWhat hath God wrought?\u201d Regarding vascular surgery, what hath the SVS wrought? Since 1947, we created the modern specialty of Vascular Surgery. Our meetings and publications have catalyzed steady improvement in surgical safety, quality, and clinical outcomes. We championed objective, noninvasive vascular testing from its earliest days. We\u2019ve raised public awareness of vascular disease, and advocated for rigorous testing and credentialing standards in vascular post-graduate education. We speak for vascular surgeons, and the patients we care for, in Washington D.C. And after decades of reducing death and disability from vascular disease, we and our international peers define the global standard for vascular care.Sustainability, as defined by Summers and Smith, \u201cis a balance between well-being (leading a good life), social equity (all people leading some form of the good life), and intergenerational equity (future generations leading good lives).\u201dWhat brought our organization to this point in its history, impressive as our accomplishments are, won\u2019t be enough to get us through the next 75\u00a0years. The world will still need vascular specialists at the turn of the next century, and looking forward to our 150th anniversary in 2096, we must evolve to ensure that the SVS remains relevant and effective in the decades to come.We want to be the best at getting better \u2013 it\u2019s in our DNA \u2013 better in our surgical technique, better in our patient care skills, better in our outcomes, better in our impact on our community, better in our ability to identify and develop talent \u2013 the future of the SVS, and by extension the specialty, depends on us getting this right.This year\u2019s JVS Supplement isn\u2019t our first attempt at defining and prioritizing diversity, equity, and inclusion \u2013 a earlier version, published in 2010, started us on this journey.As I stated in my introduction to the current Supplement, \u201cWith this update, we take up the final recommendation of the 2010 Supplement, that (in the words of the prior Supplement Editors Fred Beavers and Bagwhan Satiani) \u201cThe SVS\u2026 must look inward and focus on the membership and leadership within. A laudable goal, they wrote, is for the SVS to be a diversity-competent professional organization, which will enable it to unleash the considerable talent that surely resides within its membership.\u201dI hope you will agree with me that through intentional effort and redesign over the last decade, we are several steps closer to that goal.Thank you for the honor of serving as your President this year, and for all the professional opportunities this organization has provided me throughout my career. Despite the stress the pandemic placed on many presidential responsibilities, this has been the most rewarding year of my professional life, and for that I will always be grateful. I am grateful as well to predecessors and current colleagues on the SVS EB, especially Drs Ali AbuRahma and Michael C. Dalsing, for their unwavering support and encouragement, and to the SVS Staff for their resilience and commitment to our mission.I am especially grateful to my colleagues at Stanford Vascular Surgery, who have consistently modeled the courage, professionalism, and commitment to our patients that the public expects from us as vascular surgeons, as well as allowed me to devote the time I needed to serve the SVS as President this year. And channeling Past President Darling, I am grateful for the professionalism of our clinic and academic support staff as well, many of whom are here with us today, without whom we would not be able to provide the comprehensive vascular care our patients need and deserve.For those of you who don\u2019t know already, the SVS has a spectacular advocate and executive director in Dr Kenneth Slaw \u2013 Ken\u2019s superb insight and management skills have brought our organization to the pinnacle of its success in its 75th year of existence, and we have all benefited from his careful stewardship over the last 5\u00a0years.And finally, to all my fellow members, regardless of your career path or stage; may the SVS always be there to guide and assist you on your own professional journey. It\u2019s made all the difference to me.Thank you for your attention and for the honor of this podium this morning.",
  "2022": "It is my greatest honor to address you today as the 76th President of the Society of Vascular Surgery (SVS). Looking over our Founding Fathers and all the legendary names of the Past Presidents of our Society (, online only), I am even more humbled to have been your President. I would like to thank many of our present SVS leaders, including members of our Executive Board, Strategic Board, and various committees/chairmen, who have assisted me during the past few years regarding the numerous activities of the SVS.I would like to extend a special thanks to the recent past Presidents and other members of the Nominating Committee who nominated me to this position. It is difficult to find the words to properly express my appreciation for the confidence you have expressed in me. I would also like to extend my thanks to Dr Walter McCarthy, Dr James S. T. Yao, Dr Ken Slaw, Patricia Burton, Sara Murphy, Elsa Hall, and the rest of the SVS staff for their assistance in preparing my Presidential Address.Personal perspectiveI would like to start by thanking a select few special people who have been supportive of my professional career, and without their guidance, I would not be here today. First, my parents, who, unfortunately, could not be with us today. I know they would be very proud of my accomplishments, particularly since they were hesitant to allow me to emigrate from my country of Jordan to the United States almost 50\u00a0years ago. Both of my parents instilled in me the importance of integrity and work ethics. They also taught me important values: loyalty, honesty, and compassion.From those who are with us today, I would like to thank my wife, Marion, who has been supportive of my professional career and gave me unlimited support and love during these past 40\u00a0years. Marion () has been my companion and will always be my closest friend, and I have learned I can always lean on her when needed. As a caring mother, she dedicated most of her time in raising our children and for being a loving mother and wife. She inspired all of us to be the best we could be. My three children, Zach, Chelsea, and Joseph (), who have been patient and understanding regarding my responsibilities as a clinical vascular surgeon and academician. Thank you for giving me the fulfillment that professional success alone could not provide. They have given me insight into my shortcomings. For Zach in particular, I want to thank you for your professional support during this past year with my busy schedule as SVS President.I first came to America almost 50\u00a0years ago. At the time, I knew I would be leaving my family back home, but what I did not know is the family I was about to have when I got here. Dr Bruce Perler has been that family. To say he\u2019s been \u201clike a brother\u201d to me doesn\u2019t do it justice, because the truth is, he is a brother to me. He not only served as a former President 6\u00a0years ago but has been a leader and pioneer for vascular surgery over 30\u00a0years. Bruce, on behalf of all of us, thank you.I would like to recognize a few leaders who have had a major impact on my professional career, beginning with our late Chairman of Surgery at West Virginia University/Charleston Area Medical Center, Dr James Boland (, online only). He fostered my interest in vascular surgery and served as an unselfish, talented mentor during my early academic career. Next, the late Dr Edward Diethrich (, online only), who taught me most of my vascular technical skills during my vascular fellowship. He continued to mentor during my early career in endovascular training, where I learned many of my endovascular skills in the late 1980s and early 1990s. His visionary ideas were very motivating to me.Secondly, Dr Frank Veith (), who has been a pioneer and fought tirelessly to ensure that vascular surgery was recognized as an independent specialty. In my personal opinion, I consider Drs Veith and Diethrich to be the two most important leaders who have kept endovascular therapy in the domain of our vascular surgery specialty. I would also like to recognize two other leaders, the late Dr John Bergan (, online only) and Dr Bob Rutherford (, online only), who supported me in my academic career for close to 30\u00a0years. Together with Dr Veith, these three leaders taught me the wisdom of critical thinking and helped in advancing my academic career.I am also indebted to my associates at the Charleston Area Medical Center (CAMC)/West Virginia University Charleston Campus (), a group of 11 full-time faculty members consisting of multidisciplinary specialists, vascular surgeons, interventional radiologists, interventional cardiologists, interventional vascular medicine, and all our staff of the Vascular Center of Excellence at CAMC. I would also like to thank my Vascular Lab staff which I established 40\u00a0years ago, starting with one tech, where now I have 16 registered vascular technologists ().I must admit that, without the support of our executive leaders at CAMC, who made my job easier; and I would like to acknowledge their presence here today \u2013 Mr David Ramsey (CEO), Dr Glenn Crotty (COO), and Mr Jeff Oskin (Vice President/Administrator, CAMC Memorial Campus). They have been true partners in what we have accomplished in Charleston.I spent the past year thinking of a topic to present to you today, and after speaking to several past Presidents, and listening to comments from our members, I felt that, perhaps, visiting the past history of the SVS and the changes that have been made in the present SVS, and to see what the future of the SVS may hold, might be an appropriate topic. Some of you also raised the question, are we inclusive enough or are we still as exclusive as we were 50\u00a0years ago? As Albert Einstein said,\u201cThe distinction between the past, present, and future is only a stubbornly persistent illusion.\u201dAs you will appreciate, the unparalleled leadership of the SVS in the field of circulatory disease reflects not only the wisdom of our past leaders the organization\u2019s commitment to evolution over time.SVS past Presidents born outside the continental United StatesAt a time of unfortunate xenophobia in our culture, the SVS has always been an open international Society, and this is no better reflected than in the backgrounds of so many of our past leaders. SVS is open to vascular surgeons around the globe, advancing vascular surgery, a specialty that has no borders. Let\u2019s start by visiting past SVS Presidents who were born outside the continental United States (US). Fifteen of 75 SVS past Presidents and two of 31 charter members were born outside the US. Let\u2019s look into their contributions in advancing our vascular surgery specialty.Dr Geza de Takats, who served as President in 1953, was born in Budapest and completed his surgical training at the University of Budapest and Copenhagen. He was awarded a traveling fellowship by the Rockefeller Foundation where he visited several American clinics: Cushing, Whipple, and Mayo. He established a Vascular Clinic at Northwestern in 1926, and became Professor Emeritus at Rush and Illinois University. He served as President of the Chicago Heart Association, Chicago Surgical Society, and the North American chapter of the International Society of Cardiovascular Surgeons (ISCVS). Perhaps his major contribution was his landmark paper on anticoagulation therapy and pulmonary embolism in 1939 and 1940 in the Journal of the American Medical Association.Dr R. Linton, who served as the SVS President in 1955, was born in Fort William, Scotland. He was the son of a sheep farmer and went to the University of Edinburgh School of Medicine. He had major interests in physiology where he joined the Walter Cannon Physiology lab at Harvard, completed his surgical residency at Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH), and established the Linton Fellowship in 1981. He started the postgraduate vascular training at MGH in 1946, where many of our leaders in Vascular Surgery completed their training. He pioneered the era of arterial reconstructions and aortic homograft in\u00a01950.Dr Fiorindo A. Simeone served as President in 1962 and was born in Italy. He attended Brown University and Harvard Medical School, with a major interest in physiology where he served under Professor Walter Cannon. He was awarded an Honorary Degree of Science from Brown University in 1954 and assisted in developing cardiac surgery at the American University of Beirut, where its President designated him Commander, Order of the Cedars, and he became chairman of the American Heart Association Council in Cardiovascular Surgery and President of the Stroke Council of the American Heart Association. He established the first vascular lab with Linton at MGH and served as its first director.Dr Wilfred Bigelow served as the SVS President in 1968. He was born in Canada, and completed his residency at Johns Hopkins. He received an honorary degree from LLD Brandon and was Professor of Surgery Emeritus at the University of Toronto. He served as the President of the American Association for Thoracic Surgery, Vice President of the American College of Surgeons and the ISCVS, and the President of the Canadian Cardiovascular Society. He received many awards, including the Award of Merit/City of Toronto, Award of Merit National Heart Foundation of Canada, Officer, Order of Canada, The Queen Medal of the 25th Anniversary of Her Majesty, and the Canadian Medical Hall of Fame. He refined hypothermia and is credited as the first surgeon to complete the first successful human application in open heart surgery and pioneered the pacemaker in\u00a01951.Dr Emerick Szilagyi, who served as the SVS President in 1983, was born in Hungary. He attended the University of Kolozsvar, Romania and the Sorbonne in Paris before migrating to the US. He graduated from the University of Michigan and served as the Chairman of Surgery at Henry Ford for over 35\u00a0years. He also served as president of Central Surgical, Midwest Vascular, the North American Chapter of ISCVS, and Western Surgical. He performed the first aortic aneurysmal repair on live television in 1958. He also was a founding editor of the Journal of Vascular Surgery.Dr John Bergan, an innovative and pioneering surgeon who served as the President of SVS in 1984, was born in Mexico to American parents. His major achievements include President of the American Venous Forum and Foundation, Midwest Vascular Society, European-American Venous Symposium, Chicago Surgical Society, and many other societies. He received the Rovsing Silver Medal (Danish Surgical Society), honorary FRCS England, and lifetime achievement awards of the International Society of Endovascular Specialists. John established one of the earliest clinical vascular fellowships in 1976 at Northwestern with Dr Yao, which was a genesis for many of our vascular leaders. He authored 40 books and 800 publications. Drs Bergan and Yao initiated a series of postgraduate vascular conferences at Northwestern in the early 1970s that continue today. In my judgement, he was inspirational and considered by many to be the best communicator vascular surgery has ever known. His writing skills were unique, and his oral delivery was legendary.Dr James S. T. Yao, who served as the President of the SVS in 1993, was born in Canton, China. He attended the National Taiwan University School of Medicine, moved to the US, completed his training at Cook County Hospital in Illinois, and then joined Professor Irvine at the Surgical Unit at St Mary\u2019s Hospital School of Medicine in London. He pioneered the use of the ankle-brachial index. He received his PhD in vascular physics from the University of London. Dr. Yao served as President of Midwest Vascular, American Venous Forum, and received the SVS Lifetime Achievement Award and the Rene-LeRiche Prize. He was also honored by Mayor Richard Daley, who proclaimed Wednesday September 21, 2005, as Jim Yao Day in Chicago. He published over 500 peer-reviewed articles and chapters and 53 textbooks.Dr Christopher K. Zarins, who served as the President of SVS in 1999, was born in Latvia. He was educated at Johns Hopkins School of Medicine and completed his surgical residency at the University of Michigan and his fellowship at Johns Hopkins. He served as Chief of Vascular Surgery at the University of Chicago. He later moved to become Chief of Vascular Surgery at Stanford University until 2005. Dr Zarins\u2019 major achievements include the Three Star Order from Latvia, which is the highest civilian honor, and an honorary doctorate degree from Riga Stradins University, Latvia in\u00a02010.Dr Ramon Berguer served as President of the SVS in 2001 and was born in Barcelona, Spain. He received his MD with honors from the University of Barcelona. He was multi-talented; once a Formula One race car driver and an artist who was a friend of Picasso. He trained at Henry Ford Hospital in Vascular Surgery, Kings College Hospital where he obtained his PhD in engineering, and joined the faculty at Wayne State in Detroit, where he practiced for 30\u00a0years. Ramon served as Editor of the Annals of Vascular Surgery, and, in 1987, the French Academic Community awarded him an honorary doctorate at the University of Marseille. In 2004, he joined the University of Michigan where was the first Frankel Professor of Vascular Surgery. His contributions include original techniques for carotid and vertebral artery reconstruction, along with his book, Surgery of the Arteries of the Head, which is considered a classic.Dr Gregorio Sicard served as President of the SVS in 2005 and was born in Puerto Rico. He attended Medical School at the University of Puerto Rico and completed his training at the Barnes Hospital at Washington University, St Louis. In 2011, Dr. Sicard had a Distinguished Professorship named for him at Washington University, St Louis, and as President of the SVS, he was instrumental in the merger of the two competing vascular Societies. He mentored over 50 vascular fellows, was passionate about training the next generation of surgeons, and was instrumental in forming the first fellowship program at Washington University in the 1980s. He is widely known as a surgeon\u2019s surgeon, and many of his mentees became head of their own programs, both in the US and internationally.Dr Enrico Ascher, who served as the President of SVS in 2006, was born in Egypt, but grew up in Brazil. He attended Medical School in Rio de Janerio and completed his general surgery residency at New York Medical College and his Vascular Fellowship at Montefiore Medical Center with Dr Frank Veith. He joined the faculty at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine and became Director of Vascular Surgery at Maimonides Medical Center. In 2011, Dr. Ascher joined New York University as Professor of Surgery and became the Chief of Vascular and Endovascular Therapy at Langone Hospital, New York University. He served as President of the Eastern Vascular Society, The Society of Clinical Vascular Surgery, and the International Society for Vascular Surgery. He is a pioneer in many lower extremity reconstruction procedures over the past 30\u00a0years and popularized the use of duplex ultrasound in lower extremity endo procedures and carotid intervention. He is well-known among world leaders because he served as President of World Federation of Vascular Societies and as Chairman of the Pan American Congress for two decades.Dr K. Wayne Johnston, who served as the President of SVS in 2007, was born in Canada. He was educated at the University of Toronto and served as Research Fellow and Senior Surgical Registrar at King\u2019s College Hospital in London. His major contributions include the Order of Canada, 2018, for Foundational Leadership as Surgeon, Researcher, and Educator in the field of Vascular Surgery. He received the Lifetime Achievement Award from the SVS and became the Editor-in-Chief of the Journal of Vascular Surgery, and served as Co-Editor of Rutherford\u2019s Vascular Surgery, the 7th and 8th editions. He served as the R. Fraser Elliot Chair in Vascular Surgery and co-founded the Canadian SVS in 1978, where he became President in 1987. Dr Johnston had keen interests in Doppler ultrasound and its application in pulsatile flow.Dr Anton N. Sidawy, who served as the President of SVS in 2010, was born in Syria, and presently is the Professor and Chairman of Surgery at George Washington Medical School. He completed surgical training at Washington Hospital Center and Fellowship at Boston University Hospital. His major achievements include serving as President of the Society for Clinical Vascular Surgery (SCVS) and the Eastern Vascular Society and being awarded the LaSalle D. Lafall Award for outstanding contributions to the entire metropolitan Washington community. He was recently elected to chair the American College of Surgeons Board of Regents. His major interests in health policy issues led him to serve on the Health Policy Committee of the SVS, Surgical Quality Alliance, and Patient Safety Organization Improvement Committee of the American College of Surgeons. He has a special interest in the management of lower extremity diabetic vascular disease and was instrumental in establishing the Vascular Center Verification for the SVS. He also served as Co-Editor of the Journal of Vascular Surgery, and Co-Editor of the Rutherford Textbook of Vascular Surgery, 9th and 10th editions. He edited two other textbooks: The Basic Science of Vascular Disease and Diabetic Foot, Lower Extremity Arterial Disease, and Limb Salvage.Dr Peter Gloviczki, who served as the President of SVS in 2013, was born in Hungary and completed Medical School in Budapest, Residency and Fellowship in General and Vascular Surgery in Budapest, Paris, and Rochester, Minnesota. He is Emeritus Professor of Surgery at Mayo Clinic and is the previous Division Chair and Director of Mayo Clinic Gonda Vascular Center. His hobby is magic and is known as \u201cThe Magic Man of SVS.\u201d Dr. Gloviczki\u2019s major achievements include serving as President of the World Federation Society of Vascular Surgery, the American Venous Forum, the International Union of Angiology, and the SCVS. He had 19 national and international honorary memberships, including The Medal of the City of Paris, received an Honorary Doctorate Degree from Semmelweis University, and received the George Washington Award from the American Hungarian Foundation. He was awarded the Officers Cross of the Order of Merit of the Republic of Hungary, and he served as the Editor-in-Chief of the Journal of Vascular Surgery.Dr Michel Makaroun, who served as the President of SVS in 2019, was born in Beirut, Lebanon. He presently serves as Professor and Chief, Division of Vascular Surgery, at the University of Pittsburgh, where he completed his training. His major achievements include serving as President of the Eastern Vascular Society, SCVS, and the Association of Program Directors of Vascular Surgery. Mac served as the chair of the largest academic Vascular Program in the US and mentored many prominent vascular members of the SVS.The past SVS structure and committees into the present SVSIn the early SVS years and during the first 50\u00a0years, there were very limited numbers of standing committees including the membership, program, nominating, and committee on arrangements for the Vascular Annual Meeting (VAM).Membership Committee/total SVS membershipLet\u2019s examine the membership committee. In the 1957 Constitution bylaws, the number of active members shall be limited to 150. In 1963, that number was changed to 250, with no more than 10 new members added per year. Consistent with our commitment to inclusion, the SVS today has no limit on the number of active members, nor the number added per year. To give you an example, in 1991, only 10 members were selected to become members of the SVS, including myself and your President-elect, Michael Dalsing. When I became Chair of the Membership Committee in 2010, the committee consisted of five members. Two hundred twenty members were approved, and the total number of SVS members as of June 2010 was 3145. In 2021-2022 the membership committee was expanded to 11 members. The number of members approved was 104, and the total number of SVS members as of June 2022 is 6434.(online only) shows the number of memberships over the past 15\u00a0years.SVS International chaptersThe International Relations Committee was established in 2008, and in 2010, the first International Forum was held at VAM. The committee developed guidelines for establishing international chapters, with the first two being in India and Columbia. Today, there are 13 international chapters, including Argentina, Brazil, China, Columbia, Egypt, Germany, Austria, Switzerland, Hungary, India, Mexico, Italy, Japan, Poland, and Taiwan.Membership Committee composition/selectionThe membership committee composition and selection also changed. In the past, the SVS bylaws indicated the membership shall consist of three elected members who shall serve overlapping terms of three years each, plus the Secretary as an ex-officer member. The President has the authority to appoint members to the standing committees and is usually selected at the VAM. In the present SVS, the membership committee is selected by the appointment committee.Membership qualifications past/presentMembership qualifications also changed. In the past, application forms were available only by request of a member and provided by the secretary. Application forms presenting the CV of the candidate and signed by two endorsers and a sponsor were sent to the secretary at least 4\u00a0months prior to the annual executive session to be acted upon. There was a major emphasis on the academic achievement of the applicant, and a reprint of three outstanding publications was to be sent to the Secretary. In contrast, SVS presently is open for new membership for qualified vascular surgeons from both academic and community practice fields, regardless of their publication. The membership committee meets quarterly to review applications for executive board approval. The Distinguished Fellow Program was established and developed to recognize members who distinguish themselves by sustained contributions to vascular surgery through research, teaching, clinical, and/or creative accomplishments.In 2005 and 2007, the bylaws were amended to provide affiliate and associate membership. This opened the door to non-physician members and other non-surgical physician members, such as vascular medicine specialists and podiatrists. In 2017, the category of candidate membership was established, which includes medical students and general surgery residents.SVS membership sectionsSeveral SVS membership sections were established in 2017 to provide a forum for discussion of education, research, and practice issues in their respective areas of vascular focus or special interest. The primary focus is to increase educational offerings for this sector of membership. The first section established was the physician assistants section, which has more than 200 members today. We now have four additional sections, which include community practice, including a sub-section of outpatient and office vascular care, women\u2019s section, and the young surgeon\u2019s section.SVS community practice sectionThe SVS community practice section was established in the 2021-2022 business year and currently has 215 members, which include the section on outpatient vascular care/office-based lab section. In 2022, VAM programming included the community practice sessions titled \u201cStarting your own independent practice\u201d and \u201cProviding outpatient vascular care in the office-based lab.\u201dSVS women\u2019s section Steering CommitteeThe women\u2019s section of the Steering Committee, which currently has 138 members, was recently established during the 2021-2022 business year, and the 2022 VAM Program included a women\u2019s session titled \u201cSupporting women vascular surgeons \u2013 from the recruitment through senior leadership.\u201dSVS young surgeon\u2019s sectionThe SVS young surgeon\u2019s section, which was established during the 2021-2022 business year, has a total of 70 current members. The VAM 2022 Program also included \u201cYoung surgeon\u2019s session program.\u201dEvolution of appointment processLet\u2019s examine the evolution of the appointment process. From 2017 to 2018, the appointment process consisted of a three-member committee: The President-Elect, who serves as chair, the President, and Vice President; there was limited application information; applicants could apply for all committees; and members could be appointed to many committees without limit. In 2021-2022, the appointment process radically changed to have a six-member committee consisting of the previous three members, and added three members representing the young surgeons, diversity, equity, and inclusion, and community practice committees. The application asks for more broad information, including practice type, gender, ethnicity, and demographics, to inform diversity. Applicants are required to provide statements of interest for each committee and can be appointed to no more than two committees. The call for volunteers is announced in various vascular publications, including the SVS Pulse.2021-2022 Appointment committee membership profileThe total number of positions appointed for 2021-2022 were 535, the number of open positions were 164, the number of applicants were 237, and applicants appointed were 149 (61%).(online only) shows the member profile regarding gender, race, ethnicity, etc.Governance Board of DirectorsLet us now examine the governance of the Board of Directors. During the early years of the SVS, the SVS Officers consisted of the President, Vice President (President-Elect), Secretary, Treasurer, and Recorder. The council in 1955 only consisted of the officers; in 1963, the immediate three past presidents plus the officers; in 1973, the president and secretary of the North American Chapter of the ISCVS, served on the council as ex officer members without votes. In 1982, the Society Representative of the American College of Surgeons became a non-voting member and was added to the council. The SVS Board of Directors at the time of the merger was comprised of seven SVS officers, 11 representatives from regional and national vascular societies, chairs of education, clinical practice council, fellows council, and research council, totaling 23. The Executive Council met between board meetings to address SVS activities, as authorized by the Board of Directors.Executive BoardThe Executive Board consisted of officers, chair of the fellow council, and one at-large society representative from the Board as elected by the society representative serving on the board. In 2017, the bylaws were amended as follows: the executive board was comprised of nine members including President, immediate past President, President-Elect, Vice President, Secretary, Treasurer, Chair of Community Practice, Chair of VAM, and the Representative of the Strategic Board of Directors. The Executive Board serves as the governing body of the SVS with full authority to manage and act on all affairs, except in matters limited by the bylaws where approval of the SVS members at VAM is required. A large Board of Directors became the strategic board, which serves as a strategic body of SVS that is responsible for developing SVS strategic plans and fostering and strengthening inter- and intra-society relations. The Strategic Board consists of 24 members: six officers, chairs of councils, chair of VAM program committee, chair of the patient safety organization executive council, chair of community practice committee, and representatives from 11 vascular societies.SVS councils, committees, sections, and task forces(online only) shows the councils, committees that are under each council, sections, and task forces, which show how the SVS works.Nominating CommitteeLet us examine the Nominating Committee process. In the past, the SVS Nominating Committee consisted of three members appointed by the President 1\u00a0month before VAM, usually the three immediate past Presidents, and its function was to compile a slate of officers to be presented to the Executive Council and members at the VAM. In 2003, the nominating committee consisted of the two most recent surviving and available past Presidents, two members-at-large from the Board of Directors, one elected annually from the 11 representatives of the other vascular societies represented on the Board, and one elected annually by the five representatives of the council seated on the Board of Directors from among memberships of the council. Currently (starting in 2017 from bylaw amendment), it consists of seven members; three most recent and surviving and available past Presidents with the most senior as chair, one member that is elected annually from and by the 11 representatives of the regional and vascular societies serving on the strategic board, one member-at-large elected from the SVS membership who is not currently serving on the executive board, the vice-chair of community practice, and the chair of leadership and diversity committee.Election of officersPast SVS officer elections were conducted at the VAM business meeting. Only those eligible voting members who attend VAM were able to participate. The present SVS bylaws were amended to allow for electronic voting by all eligible members prior to the annual business meeting. The Nominating Committee is now tasked with presenting a slate of two candidates for each open officer position. The call for nomination is advertised by SVS publications to invite people to nominate for officers.SVS futureLet us shift into the future of the SVS. We must keep branding the value of vascular surgery, continue pushing for fair and appropriate payment and system change for our services; supporting our community practice section with all its need is extremely critical. We must be united, have a common message across members, and keep investing in embracing diversity and cultural change. We should keep investing in our health and wellness and our early career members, which is critical for our future. We must continue to embrace quality in vascular patient care, and finally, we must work towards finding a common pathway in working with other non-vascular surgeon providers who practice endovascular therapy based on acceptable dedicated training in endovascular intervention. One major player in this regard is the American College of Cardiology and our interventional cardiology colleagues.SVS and investment in community/outpatient practicesThe SVS has done a lot of investment in community and outpatient practices. Over the past 8\u00a0years, investment in the community and outpatient practice has been exponential and has, just to name a few, established the community practice committee, evolved into a larger section on community practice, and changed the SVS bylaws/policy to establish permanent presence of community practice in the SVS Strategic Board, Executive Board, Nominating Committee, and Appointment Committee. We established the section of outpatients and office-based care to gather and organize 215 members practicing in this setting to further education and build program value. We have regular programming at VAM designed and presented by leaders in community practice and established the Community Practice Lifetime Achievement Awards Programs.Common pathway for endovascular therapy by non-vascular surgeonsFinally, let us examine the common pathway for endovascular therapy by nonvascular surgeons. Vascular surgeons are a relative minority in the crowded field of specialists who treat vascular disease, but is the only specialty exclusively devoted to the diagnosis and treatment of vascular disease. Vascular surgeons are the only specialists who provide the entire spectrum of treatment options, including medical, open, and endovascular intervention. The vascular surgery board certification is the definitive measure of the vascular surgeon\u2019s expertise in treating vascular disease and differentiates us from other specialists. Many specialties are attracted to performing vascular procedures in light of workforce shortage, and mal distribution creates access issues to vascular surgeons. Advances in treatment and device technology make therapy for increasing number of vascular conditions within the perceived scope of other specialists, some of whom are without adequate training.Recent VQIdata that examines several thousands of patients undergoing endovascular aneurysm repair, open aortic reconstruction, carotid endarterectomy, or carotid stenting is shown in the. Vascular surgeons still perform a major part of endovascular aneurysm repair (57%) and open aortic surgery (57%), around 50% of carotid endarterectomies, but only 22% of carotid stenting, where our cardiology colleagues performed around 42%.What should our strategy be? How can SVS best position itself to take the lead in shaping the future of vascular surgery care delivery and optimizing patient outcomes? Can demonstrated competence and quality metrics be established and agreed upon across specialties? Who are the critical partners to engage in the dialogue? The American College of Cardiology, Society for Interventional Radiology, Society for Cardiovascular Angiography and Interventions, and Society of Vascular Medicine3? Are there highly successful multi-specialty models to be demonstrated? All of us know politics are local.This brings me to the concept of multispecialty practice in vascular surgery, which started at Ashford General Hospital in White Sulphur Springs, in my home state of West Virginia. The concept of the vascular service line has existed since World War II. The War Department purchased The Greenbrier, West Virginia on September 1, 1942, for 3.3 million dollars and converted the hotel into a 2000 bed hospital focusing on vascular surgery and neurosurgical issues in soldiers. During a 4-year period, over 24,000 soldiers were treated, and it was nicknamed \u201cThe Shangri-La for Wounded Soldiers,\u201d and was considered the center for vascular innovation at that time. New surgical techniques in treating vascular fistulas, aneurysms, and post-traumatic ischemia were done at that center. Initially, the team consisted of surgeons with extensive vascular experience, internal medicine specialists to treat other disorders including chronic vasospastic syndromes, frostbite, Buerger\u2019s disease, deep venous thrombosis, post-traumatic venous ulcers, etc. The Ashford Hospital became the undisputed Vascular Center of Excellence (VCOE) in 1944 (). The VCOE concept proved that multidisciplinary centers of excellence will improve outcomes.Fast-forward 50\u00a0years later to 1994, where the concept of our modern VCOE in Charleston, WV was born. Heterogeneity of the cardiovascular practice patterns and outcomes were recognized, with the initial vision being to bring all cardiovascular MDs under one roof: however, that didn\u2019t materialize. In 1996, the focus shifted to medicine and vascular surgery with the cooperation between myself and my colleague, Dr Mark Bates, an interventional cardiologist/vascular intervention. The CORE issues were discussed, where the radiologists felt they owned the field because they did early pioneering work but were reluctant to do long-term follow-up and were not experienced in complex medical issues and complications. Another issue was that vascular surgeons had extensive training in vascular diseases and surgery but lacked experience with catheter procedures in these early years, whereas cardiologists had extensive catheter skills, but no training related to the end-organ by many of them at that time. Recognizing turf challenges, with support from Charleston Area Medical Center Leadership, the Circulatory Dynamic Laboratory suite was opened independently from radiology and cardiology in\u00a01996.Our VCOE model included physicians with the following qualifications: approved vascular fellowship/residency, interventional radiology fellowship, interventional cardiology fellowship with a minimum of one year in peripheral intervention, and two years of vascular medicine/vascular intervention fellowship. Our present VCOE () includes 12 MDs: eight board-certified vascular surgeons, two board-certified cardiologists/vascular interventionists, one board-certified vascular medicine/interventionist, and one board-certified interventional radiologist. All are employed full-time by West Virginia University/Charleston Campus and CAMC, and all practice at CAMC under one division academic chief with two co-directors of VCOE.Over the past several months, I conducted a survey among SVS members to assess how their interests in multispecialty models in practicing vascular surgery. Several hundred people responded to the survey. When they were asked \u201cHow would you characterize your practice?\u201d close to 50% indicated that they had a single-specialty group practice. When they were asked if there is a threat to the viability of their vascular practice, or competition from non-vascular surgeon providers, roughly 80% felt that competition comes from interventional cardiologists or cardiologists. Close to 50% also felt threatened by interventional radiologists. When they were asked \u201cDo you practice in a multispecialty group that includes other non-vascular surgeons?\u201d 42% said yes, and 58% said no. When they were asked \u201cDo you think non-vascular surgeons, specifically cardiologists/interventional cardiologists, should be doing endovascular intervention if they have formal dedicated training in endovascular intervention?\u201d 65% responded yes, which means that the issue here is they do not believe interventional cardiologists or cardiologists should be doing endovascular intervention if they do not have the proper training. Over 70% felt they should receive one or two years of endovascular intervention training.Ladies and gentlemen, as a young man, I immigsrated to this country from Jordan to seek the best surgical training available. I have been truly blessed to become part of an amazing, exceptional specialty, vascular surgery, and am so grateful to have benefitted from mentors who invested in me and my career, so that today I stand before you as the latest international President of the SVS, the preeminent global vascular surgical society in the world. I thank you very much for giving me the honor of serving as your President. I would like you to enjoy the following song, which has been adopted as our \u201cunofficial\u201d song, \u201cTake Me Home, Country Roads\u201d by John Denver, and close by sharing with you some of the beauty of our state, wild and wonderful West Virginia (and, online only).Appendix (online only)"
